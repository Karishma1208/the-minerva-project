- How does ```react-snap``` help in speeding up the performance of React pages?
- How to pre-render pages in React application?

## Pre-rendering routes.

Let's understand pre-rendering with an example:

Let's say we have created an amazing web application in React. However, given the number of elements invovled, our application is very big in terms of resources. Hence, we used bundling to cut down on our application size. However, with out application poised to grow more, the size of our bundle will also be increasing. If our bundle size is large, it will take equivalent amount of time for the bundle to get downloaded and meanwhile, our web page will keep showing a blank page. What should we do?

This is where pre-rendering comes into the picture.
