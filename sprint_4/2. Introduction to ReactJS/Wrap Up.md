# Wrap Up

## What did you learn?

In this concept, before we moved to React, we understood how React shaped the front-end industry from being a slow rendering industry to loading efficient and quick webpages. We also learnt about Single Page Applications and their advantages over traditional multi page applications. Finally, we learnt about JSX – a template language and how it is used in React.

We also wrote our first code in React. CONGRATS!

## Key take-aways

-	Traditional web applications had a multi-page feel to them. Every screen was divided into a new HTML file and every time the page would reload and download the new HTML to be displayed.
-	Eventually, frameworks like jQuery, first, and AJAX later simplified coding in web-development.

-	AngularJS ushered in the age of Single Page Applications (SPAs). In SPAs, there is only one HTML file while the feel of multi-page is achieved by using AJAX or other means to update elements without refreshing the page.

-	However, there were disadvantages to AngularJS which were overcome by React. 
-	React is the analogy of V in an MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture.

-	React relies heavily on element reusability and hence, making it quicker and more efficient.

-	It also boasts of a concept called as Virtual DOM which is a copy of real DOM tree and updates only if necessary.

-	JSX is a template syntax for HTML. Using JSX, you can add HTML code in variables and then use these variables for creating DOM.

-	JSX is not string literals.

-	You can create React applications without JSX by using traditional JavaScript methods. However, to use JSX, you need Babel – a package which makes older browsers understand latest JavaScript syntax ES6 which is heavily used in React.

## How will it help the project?

After this concept, you have already taken the first step in building the project.

Just to show the power of React, following is comparision of the financial portfolio tracker you are going to make with and without React.

**With ReactJS**

**Without ReactJS**

As ridiculous the blank screen may seem, after writing your first ReactJS code, you must have understood that all the elements and components of a React Application are populated by React itself.
That means without any React code files, we will have only blank screen in the application.
