# Introduction to Competetive Programming

## Overview

The initial rounds in most recreuitment process start with coding tests. These are usually conducted on online 3rd party platforms. The tests can have multiple programming problems that test your algorithms on the accuracy of output as well as he run time efficiency. It is important to familirize yourself with these platoforms.

## Learing Objectives

- What is Competetive Programming
- Get a feel of a programming environment
- Navigate through the steps required to solve a problem

## Introduction

While solving the problem go through the following steps:

-   Read the problem very carefully
-   The question is usually followed up with sample Inputs and Outputs. Survey them to conclude that your understanding of the problem is correct
-   Take note of the input format
-   Chart out a basic approach
-   Implement after selecting the language of your choice. The javascript that you learnt in the previous sprints would be very helful here. You may brush up a little before you start to code.
-   Analyze if it is the most efficient solution. (Hint!..If it uses nested loops, there is usually a better way)
-   Once you submit, it is usually tested on multiple test cases. If your solution fails a test case, that indicates an error in logic. Try to look at [boundary conditions](https://www.google.com/search?q=boundary+conditions&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8&aq=t).

## What you must do
- Go through the [Javascript cheat sheet](https://htmlcheatsheet.com/js/). Make sure you remember how to implement loops, conditionals, declare variables and manipulate strings.
-   Try Solving the warm up questions on [Hackerrank](https://www.hackerrank.com/interview/interview-preparation-kit/warmup/challenges)
-   After solving, navigate to the editorial page to check correct solutions. Also read the dsicussions to gain an insight into different approaches
