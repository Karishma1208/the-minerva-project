## Overview

GitHub is a platform that provides hosting for software development version control using Git. It is a subsidiary of Microsoft. It offers all of the distributed version control and source code management (SCM) functionality of Git as well as adding its own features. It provides access control and several collaboration features such as bug tracking, feature requests, task management, and wikis for every project.

GitHub offers plans for free, professional, and enterprise accounts. Free GitHub accounts are commonly used to host open source projects.

## Why GitHub

As of 2018, GitHub reported having more than 28 million users, significantly more than its competitors. Most of the company prefers using this platform over any other for hosting code repositories.

The other differences involve cost. GitHub offers private repositories only at an additional cost, while a few of the other services offer private repositories for free. However, these typically come with limited storage and bandwidth.

Using GitHub makes it easier to collaborate with colleagues and peers and look back at previous versions of your work. If you aren't already using GitHub for your coding projects, here are a few reasons to consider doing so.

## What you must do

- Before you go through this concept, ensure that you are thorough with the fundamentals of github. It is part of the sprint in the Foundations program. Rest of the reading material is good practices in GitHub and advanced operations inside GitHub like code review, pull requests etc. These are important tools that every web developer and software engineer needs to know.  
- To ensure that you are a good collaborator while coding, it is important to write good commit messages and clearly convey what changes you have made to the code to your teammates. Understand the importance of writing good commit messages and learn how to make sure you always [follow the rules in the guide for commit messages](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)
- Code reviews are important to improve code quality and get feedback from peers. Understand what [Code review](https://medium.com/palantir/code-review-best-practices-19e02780015f) is and learn its [github implementation](https://github.com/features/code-review/).
- Pull requests are needed to inform the collaborators about the changes you have made to the repository. Learn how to make [effective pull requests](https://yangsu.github.io/pull-request-tutorial/)
- Everyone does not work on the master branch. Collaborators work on different branches. This might be slightly tricky but with practice, you will get the hang of it. Understand what is [branching in github](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Basic-Branching-and-Merging). Then read about the [branching model](https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/) adopted by a larger section of the industry
- Every repository needs a good documentation of what the repository is about, what it does, etc. This information is contained in a README.md which is the default file rendered to the user. Know [what a Readme file is](https://www.makeareadme.com/) and learn [how to create a well defined one](https://bulldogjob.com/news/449-how-to-write-a-good-readme-for-your-github-project)
- Go through a case study on [use of Github in project lifecycle](https://product.hubspot.com/blog/git-and-github-tutorial-for-beginners). Use that knowledge to then learn [how to leverage Github to get the first job/impress a potential recruiter](https://hackernoon.com/how-to-optimize-your-github-profile-9540f338b2c9)

## Summary

An understanding of GitHub at an early stage would help you immensely when you are working on the code hosted on GitHub and while working with your peers.

Knowing the processes will also enable you to stand out and impress your potential recruiters.
