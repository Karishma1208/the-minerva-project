# Wrap up

## What did you learn?

In this concept, we learned the basics of how to create applications inside React. We learned about all the things that make React one of the widely accepted frameworks for creating Single Page Applications. We learnt two different approaches to add React to a website. Post that, we got introduced to create-react-app which provides a ready boilerplate for coding in React. We understood and created different types of components and their states and props. We came across lifecycle methods which helped us to control rendering in React at different stages. We then moved on to conditional rendering and rendering lists in React. Finally, we understood form elements and learnt how to do static type checking in React.


## Key take-aways

- We can add React to a website in two ways – 
    
    a) Inject in using a div and CDN or 
    
    b) Create it from scratch using a boilerplate or manually configuring a webpack.


- Create-react-app is a package which provides a readymade boilerplate for us to code in React. It takes away the tedious process of adding necessary packages so that we can concentrate solely on coding.
- There are two major types of components in React – class-based stateful components and functional stateless components.
- When we need to do only presentation of static elements, we use function-based components. 
- Class based components come with a special feature called states which provide data for the component.
- States can also be modified using one of the many lifecycle methods.
- Every component receives arguments called as props. 
- There are several lifecycle methods which span a component’s journey from creation to end. 
- We can use conditional statements and for loops to create or conditionally show certain React elements, just like in JavaScript.
- React extensively uses ES6 features like map, filter and reduce for creating lists.
- PropTypes is a packager for statically type checking your React element while creating to ensure bug-free code.
- React deals with forms differently by providing a data binding. This is called as a controlled element. Basically, it is very useful for every change made to a form element.
- Axios is a library akin to AJAX which is used for handling API calls.
- API calls should be typically made in componentDidMount.

*How will it help the project?*

All the different ReactJS concepts(Components, States, Proptypes, etc.) that you just learned should help you build the 'Financial Portfolio Tracker' app( i.e Everything except the deployment part)


Before moving onto the final concept, take a look at the [Project](../Project/README.md) and list down each functionality of the 'Financial Portfolio Tracker' app & relate it with the ReactJS concepts you just onboarded.

For eg:

1. Add Stock(User Form): Conditional Rendering and displaying Modal

2. ......

3. .......
