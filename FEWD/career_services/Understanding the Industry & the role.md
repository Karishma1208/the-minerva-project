**Overview**

An ideal employee is one who understands the inner workings of the organisation they work for as well as the industry it operates within. For example, if you are working in a travel booking app, a decent knowledge of how the travel industry operates along with the various stakeholders is good to have. This awareness improves overall performance and allows them to identify/understand the different trends and offer relevant inputs to app design and development.

**What does a Front End Engineer do?**

Front-end web development, also known as client-side development is programming HTML, CSS and JavaScript for a website or Web Application, so that a user can see and interact with them directly. The tools and techniques used to create the front end of a website change constantly, and requires the developer to constantly be aware of how the field is developing. This is the main challenge for a front-end engineer.

The objective of designing a site is to ensure that when users open the website they see the information in an easy to read and relevant format. Users now use a large variety of devices with varying screen sizes and resolutions. Optimizing the experience across all these devices becomes challenging. The website needs to be rendered correctly in different browsers (cross-browser), different operating systems (cross-platform) and different devices (cross-device), which requires careful planning on the side of the developer.

**What Tech skills are required for the role?**

In this section, we will explore different skill sets and tools that you need to acquire to be an awesome front-end engineer. We will group these into categories so that you are clear about which skills to prioritize for learning.

**Essential**
These are the core skills you need to develop if you want to call yourself a frontend engineer. If you don&#39;t have these skills or are unsure about them, then you must put in a conscious effort to build these skills.

- HTML, CSS and Javascript
- JavaScript frameworks like React/Angular/Vue (one of these is sufficient)
- Version Control like Git
- Responsive design
- Testing and Debugging
- Browser developer tools
- Decent command line expertise and HTTP/URL

**Good to Have**

Other than the skills mentioned above, having one or two of these additional skills will help you stand out from the rest of your peers. These skills will help you on the journey from a good frontend developer to a great frontend developer.

- Basics of Backend (Node.js)
- User Experience
- Data Formats (e.g., JSON, XML)
- Data APIs (e.g Restful API)
- Task Runners, Build Tools, Process Automation Tools
- Responsive Web Design
- Object-Oriented Programming
- Package Managers

**Optional**

Web development is a vast ocean having multiple things to learn. Other than the skills mentioned above, you can optionally go for a few of the skills mentioned below. Keep in mind that these skills are optional and you must focus on the essentials and good to have skills before attempting to upskill in these areas.

- Mobile Web Performance
- Accessibility / WAI-ARIA
- XHR Requests (aka AJAX)
- Web/Browser Security
- Single Page Applications
- CSS and JavaScript Animation
- Integration Testing
- Application Architecture

**What do Employers expect apart from your technical skills?**

Technical skills are the primary skills that are required, there are some equally important skills that can not be ignored.

- **Communication Skills** - There is a good 30-40% weightage given to your communication skills. These are not only important when it comes to showcasing and telling to the stakeholders what you have built but also when you are communicating to stakeholders to capture requirement.

Imagine capturing the wrong requirement and building something which was not expected/required, this leads to not just time and bandwidth loss but monetary loss as well.

So, understanding the requirements, asking the right question at each stage and communicating what you have planned and built is very important.

- **Collaboration &amp; Working as a Team -**

When it is about building great products, it is never a single person&#39;s contribution. It is always a team effort.

In any interview, you will always be evaluated if you are a team player and how open are you in working with big team. The projects that you have built in teams, comes handy here. You can talk about how did you divide the roles &amp; responsibilities and how were you able to manage the successful delivery

- **Ability to learn quickly/Open to new ideas &amp; flexible -**

Once you join an organisation, each and every day will bring in new learning. You may end up working in different projects, different teams, different technology and the need of the hour will be to pick up new things as and when required for timely &amp; successful delivery.

How open and flexible are you to learn new things and take one for the team really matters.

- **Understanding the domain -**

It is very important to read and understand the below details about the organisation you are interviewing for,

- Is it a Services company (for eg TCS, Accenture, Wipro etc) or a product company (for eg Uber, BookmyShow, Flipkart)
- What is the domain (for eg - e-commerce, Finance, Retail etc)
- Understanding how the domain works at high level

You will definitely learn a lot about the domain, once you start working but a high level understanding is important. Do go through the website of the company before the interview.

- **Awareness about recent innovation/changes in your technology -**

Demonstrating your awareness about the latest trends in the industry &amp; technology can help you stand apart from the other folks. This can be a real value add and can impress the employer. Be tuned to frontend and tech focused publications to become more aware. A good list of publications to follow can be found [here](https://dev.to/remotesynth/the-best-newsletters-to-subscribe-to-for-a-frontend-developer-1ni1).

**How does the Interview process work at a high level?**

The interview process is usually a mixture of below given steps:

- **HR Interview**

The HR interview is often candidate&#39;s first impression within a company. Typically these interviews aren&#39;t as terrifying as coding interviews. The recruiter only tries to understand if you can be a good match to the opening, or not.

- **Online-Offline Coding Test**

This round is the first step to test your technical knowledge. The questions may revolve around logical reasoning, data structures, algorithms, quantitative aptitude and coding. Typically, this is to check the aptitude and technical fundamentals of the candidate.

- **Take home challenge**

Take Home Challenge is not practised by all companies, but if they do, it&#39;s your chance to showcase your development skills without the pressure of being watched. It is usually a small task that they expect you to complete and submit within a designated period of time.

- **Face to face - Technical Round**

You may have solved the challenges given in previous rounds, from home or with the help of friends. This round will require you to present the solutions you&#39;ve provided with proper logical justifications.

- **Final Meeting &amp; Offer**

This is the final step before the company rolls out a documented offer to you. This interview may be conducted by one of the Executive team&#39;s members and/or the HR.

Remember: You will be evaluated in this round as well, and the verbal offer is NEVER the final offer unless documented.

***NOTE: As you progress in your learning journey, you will be reading more about how to prepare for these interviews and how can you master them.***

**Where is the industry headed in the Front End domain, given the ever-evolving nature of technology?**

Being a developer means you never stop learning.

The world of frontend and web development is moving fast, due to the emerging new technologies, APIs, and libraries that are changing the field.

As a result, the term &quot;full-stack developer&quot; is constantly changing and even now, it is hard to define it within the specific frameworks and languages the developer should know. One thing that&#39;s for certain though, is that there is a huge demand for full-stack developers (as evident by the numbers), with front-end developers not falling too far behind it.

In simple terms, a full-stack developer is someone who can understand both front-end as well as back-end technologies and solutions. They build programs and applications fully, combining their skills to make something that works in production.

Make sure you keep yourself up-to-date with JavaScript. Look at the trend:

[Insights from stackoverflow regarding the trend](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2019#technology)

Though, it&#39;s not particularly surprising to see JavaScript at the top of the list, as it&#39;s a development language that&#39;s vital to front-end development as well as relevant to the back-end.

It is also essential in the user-experience process in terms of user usability (scrolling, transitions, object movement, etc.).

And finally, JavaScript often includes a wide range of frameworks, web libraries, and APIs that help developers create complex applications and increase application functionality. Learning is a lifelong journey, so make a small beginning and enjoy the ride.

**Summary**

To summarise, it is important to understand what is expected from a front end engineer and how does industry work before you start building your technical skills and preparing for interviews.

While this varies from job to job, the basic awareness is a highly transferable skill that affects the way in which you work – making you more efficient, trustworthy and, ultimately, more employable.

It is a skill which must not be downplayed or forgotten about.
