### Learning Outcome

- What is HTML Hyperlink?

- How to add images in HTML?

### Introduction


So far, the HTML elements we covered are only dealing with a single web page. That's a limitation when we are dealing with "web" and therefore we need linking elements.

Hyperlink is one of the most fundamental elements of HTML. It is what makes the Web a Web. They help link resources(documents, images) across the entire web domain. Almost all web content can be converted to a link, so when clicked it will make the web browser go to another web address.

- `<a>` tag

Links are created with the `<a>` element(a stands for "anchor"). Wrapping text in `<a>` tag converts it into a link.



- `<img>` tag

Since HTML is capable of marking any content, its obvious that it will work for images as well. Though unlike text, image content is defined outside of the web page that renders it. 
Fortunately, we already have a way to refer to external resources from within an HTML document.

We use the `<img>` tag to include images in web pages.
