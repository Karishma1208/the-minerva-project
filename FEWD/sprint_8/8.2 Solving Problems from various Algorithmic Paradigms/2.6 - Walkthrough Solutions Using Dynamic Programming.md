# Walkthrough Solutions using Dynamic Programming Approach


## Overview
In this section, we will learn and explore the problems being solved using Dynamic Programming

## Learning Outcome
- What is Dynamic Programming?
- How can it be applied for solving different problems?

## Introduction

  **Dynamic programming approach**  consists of three steps for solving a problem that is as follows:
    1.  The given problem is divided into subproblems as same as in divide and conquer rule. However dynamic programming is used when the subproblems are not independent of each other but they are interrelated. I.e. they are also called as overlapping problems.
    2.  To avoid this type of recomputation of overlapping subproblem a table is created in which whenever a subproblem is solved, then its solution will be stored in the table so that in future its solution can be reused.
    3.  The solution of the subproblem is combined in a bottom of manner to obtain the optimal solution of a given problem.
