## Assignment: ARK Studio

### Objective

Build the site for a IT Firm that provides digital media services to it's clientele. Fulfill the below user stories and get all of the tests to pass.

You can use HTML and CSS to complete this project. Plain CSS is recommended because that is what the lessons have covered so far and you should get some practice with plain CSS.

##### User Story #1

Create the HTML Structure for my page looking at the design of the site provided to you. I want you to use `header`, `nav`, `section` tags that you learnt in HTML5 unit.

##### User Story #2

I need to see a page which says work in progress. Create an HTML file within the folder which will display work in progress. On clicking, the button `GET IN TOUCH WITH US` take me to this new page.

##### User Story #3

I need users to be shown a link opening in a new tab on clicking the social media icons present at the bottom. You can link your social media pages with the icon.

##### User Story #4

I want you to add necessary classes like `<p class="description"></p>` so thst you can style my site later.

##### User Story #5

I should see necessary heading tags used to show section and site headings

##### User Story #6

my site should look similar to the site you see in the template. So, apply necessary css to the html structure.

Below is the list of primary colors that have been used:

- #454545
- #50CCFF
- #606060
- #fff (conider the rgba variants too)
- #746969
- #efeded
- #616161

**BONUS TIP** - If there are any color that has not been specified, then follow these steps:

- Load the template (Image of the UI of the site) in chrome or firefox.
- Install [Colorzilla](https://www.colorzilla.com/chrome/help.html) for your browser.
