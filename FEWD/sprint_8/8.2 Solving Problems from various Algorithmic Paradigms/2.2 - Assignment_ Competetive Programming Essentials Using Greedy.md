# Assignment: Competitive Programming Problems in Greedy Approach
## Overview

We studied Greedy Approach, now we will use that for different problems.

## Learning Outcome

Implement the Greedy Approach for different problems

## What you must do?

Solve the following using Greedy Approach

 - **Find the minimum capacity of the train required to hold the passengers**
     Given the number of passengers entering and exiting the train, the task is to find the minimum capacity of the train to keep all the passengers in throughout the journey.	
	**Examples**
	```python	
		Input  enter[] = {3, 5, 2, 0}, exit[] = {0, 2, 4, 4}  
		
		Output  6  
		
		Station 1: Train capacity = 3  
		Station 2: Train capacity = 3 + 5 – 2 = 6  
		Station 3: Train capacity = 6 + 2 – 4 = 4  
		Station 4: Train capacity = 4 – 4 = 0  
		
		The maximum passengers that can be in the  train at any instance of time is 6.
	 
		Input:  enter[] = {5, 2, 2, 0}, exit[] = {0, 2, 2, 5}  
		
		Output:  5
	```

- **Minimum LCM and GCD possible among all possible sub-arrays**
Given an array **arr[]** of **N** positive integers, the task is to find the minimum [LCM](http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/lcm-gq/) and [GCD](http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/basic-and-extended-euclidean-algorithms/) between elements of all possible sub-array.
**Examples:**
```python
		Input:  arr[] = {4, 4, 8}  

		Output:  LCM = 4, GCD = 4  

		All possible sub-arrays are:  
		{4} -> LCM = 4, GCD = 4  
		{8} -> LCM = 8, GCD = 8  
		{4, 8} -> LCM = 8, GCD = 4
		
		Input:  arr[] = {2, 66, 14, 521}  

		Output:  LCM = 2, GCD = 1
```
