# Recursive v/s Iterative algorithms

## Overview

Recursion is used to solve manny problems to make the implementation more simpler and easier to follow. It is a crucial concept whose applications are spread across the DSA frontier. This concept provides an outline to how they are different than regular iterative implementation methods.

A lot of complicated problems can be solved with recursion very easily. However the challenging part is that they are not very intuitive. The only way to develop this intuition is through practice. Interviews often contain problems that can be solved quickly by employing a recursive solution. It is sure to impress the interviewer.

## Learning Outcomes

- What is Recursion
- How is recursion different from iterative implementation
- How to arrive at the correct recursive implementation

## Introduction

Any function which calls itself is called recursive. A recursive method solves a problem by calling a copy of itself to work on a smaller problem. This is called the recursion step. The recursion step can result in many more such recursive calls.
It is important to ensure that the recursion terminates. Each time the function calls itself with a
slightly simpler version of the original problem. The sequence of smaller problems must
eventually converge on the base case.<br>
