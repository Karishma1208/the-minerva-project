# Assignment

In this assignment, we will use the concepts we learnt about routing to make changes to our ‘Build My Burger’ project.

You need to do the following:
1.	In the ‘Build My Burger’ application, we had created a modal to review the order we had placed. We had also created a button to place the order. Now, we will be adding three more pages to the application.

2.	First, we will add a login page and add authentication to our application.

3.	Create a button which adds login and logout functionality on the navbar. We will add username and password in the next sprint.

4.	Next, create a database on Firebase which will be updated every time an order is placed.

5.	Also, create a page which will ask the user for information about his name, address and phone number. This page will be shown on clicking the ‘Place Order’ button.

6.	Based on the step 4, you will also create an Orders page which will show all the orders in the Firebase component. Fetch the data and show it as div which will show the name, address and phone number along with the order.

7.	Add a link to the Orders page on the navigation bar to the right and it should be guarded if the user is not logged in.
