# Assignment - Competitive Programming - Problems in Binary Tree

## Overview

We studied Binary Tree and its operations, now we will use that for different problems.

## Learning Outcome

Implement the Binary Tree and gain experience in working with Binary Trees

## What you must do?

Solve the following the Binary Tree problems

 1. Write a program to count leaf nodes in a binary tree

A node is a leaf node if both left and right child nodes of it are NULL.

 2. Given a binary tree, print postorder, pre order and inorder traversal of it
