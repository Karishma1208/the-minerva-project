# **Context APIs**

## Overview

In this session, we will discover one of the major problems with having multi-level components and how Context APIs solve them.


To get a firm grip on the concept of context, we will add that to our ‘Build My Burger’ application.


## Learning Outcome

•	What are Context APIs?

•	When do we use Context APIs?

•	How to use Context APIs?

## Context APIs

To understand Context APIs, think about an e-commerce application. In a typical e-commerce applicaiton, the user has to login first, before he/she browses through the entire website (and thereby multiple components, even multi-level components) and finally chooses one product. The user then decides to click on 'Buy Now' and fills up the 'Place Order' form.

Let's put this in a component perspective:
Login -> Home Page -> Products Page -> Product -> Order Page -> Form for placing the order.

Now, the login information which will be crucial for the e-commerce application to undersand the authentacity of the the user might be residing in the ```Login``` component. The said detail might have to traverse through many levels and across the tree to finally reach the ```PlaceOrder``` form. Imagine the number of props-passing the data has to go through. 

This is where Context API comes into picture. You simply create an object which acquires something of a global status and removes the props-passing bit.

## What you must do?

•	Read the introduction and **When to use Context** sections from the official React documentation of Context [here](https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html). 

•	Next, understand the process of Context in detail by reading [this article by Boris Yordanov](https://www.toptal.com/react/react-context-api). 

•	Continue reading the remainder of the [React documentation on Context](https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html) after the When to use Context part.

•	Go through [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLJN4JfniH4) to get a code-along example of creating Context APIs.


## Coding Practice

•	In the Main component, create an object which contains CSS properties for background-color and font-color in the main component. This will be the theme for creating our buttons.

•	The ‘Place Order’ and the ‘Order Now’ buttons will now be moved into a component which will be used in their place.

•	Using Context, pass the CSS properties from main component to the button created in ‘Button’ component.
