# The Minerva Project
Coding is the most sought after skill today. The Minerva Project aims at providing a platform to learn to code and hack it on your own. The Minerva Project consists of a carefully curated learning path with set goals to learn Web Development.

## Contribution

This means that if anyone comes across a resource that is better than what is currently included in our lessons, that person is free (and encouraged!) to add them, which improves our curriculum over time and helps it to stay up to date.
