## Overview
In this section, we study operating systems and the role it plays in a computer.
Knowledge of operating systems doesn't really have much to do with frontend frameworks, but as being a frontend developer is a subset of being a computer developer, therefore operating systems is something companies expect prospective employees to have knowledge about.

With the current trend of software development, everyone is valuing people with full stack skills so it is essential for one to be well versed in basics of computing and related concepts.

## Introduction

An  **Operating system**  is basically a intermediary agent between the user and the computer hardware. It controls the computer resources and programs running on it.
Every computer must have at least one OS to run other programs. The OS helps you to communicate with the computer without knowing how to speak the computer's language. It is not possible for the user to use any computer or mobile device without having an operating system.
