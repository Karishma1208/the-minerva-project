# Linked List Implementation of Stacks and Queues

## Overview
Most Stacks and Queues are implemented using Linked Lists. In fact, since both of them are in essence linear data structures, they act like specialized lists themselves. We will learn how to manipulate regular linked lists to make them behave stacks and queues
## Learning Outcomes
- How to implement Stacks and Queues using Lists
- Modify linked lists in general to create new data structures

## Introduction
Implementing a Stack and Queue using a linked list behaves like a modified list itself. The insert and delete functions we learnt about during the previous topic must be modified to only the element to be inserted as the position is now fixed. The function must be adapted to create the links as necessary.
