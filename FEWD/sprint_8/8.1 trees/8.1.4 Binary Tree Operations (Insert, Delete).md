# Binary Tree Operations (Insert, Delete)

## Overview
We know how to access different values in a binary tree using BFS and DFS. Insertion and Deletion are just one step over the search process. 
As the main purpose of a data structure is to store and retrieve values, it is important that it has functionality to add and remove values from it.

## Learning Outcome

- How to insert a value into a binary tree?
- How to delete a value from a binary tree?

## Introduction

Binary trees are data structures, so it is essential to have an option to add and remove value from it. We will extend the knowledge acquired in the previous section to insert and delete values.

## What you must do?
Study how to [insert value into a binary tree](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/insertion-in-a-binary-tree-in-level-order/)
Explore [deletion of a value from a binary tree](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/deletion-binary-tree/)
