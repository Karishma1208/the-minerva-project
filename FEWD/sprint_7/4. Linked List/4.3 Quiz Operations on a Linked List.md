    - Yes
    - No

2. In the worst case, the number of comparisons needed to search a singly linked list of length n for a given element is
   - logn
   - nlogn
   - n
   - n*n

3. Arrange the following in order<br>
   a. Create a node<br>
   b. Iterate a list from head to node before point of Insertion<br>
   c. Store the value of next node in a separate variable<br>

   e. Point new node to next<br>

   - b,c,a,d,e
   - a,b,d,c,e
   - d,b,a,c,e
   - a,c,b,d,e

4. What does the following function do for a given Linked List with first node as head?<br>
```C++
void fun1(struct node* head)
{
    if(head == NULL)
    return;
    fun1(head->next);
    printf("%d  ", head->data);
}
```
    - Prints all nodes of linked lists
    - Prints all nodes of linked list in reverse order
    - Prints alternate nodes of Linked List
    - Prints alternate nodes in reverse order

5. What does the following function do for a given Linked List with first node as head?<br>

	node.setNext(head);
	head = node;
	size++;
}
```
    - Insert at front
    - Insert at end
    - Do nothing
