# Assignment: Competitive Programming Problems in Binary Search Tree

## Overview

We studied Binary Search Tree and its operations, now we will use that for different problems.

## Learning Outcome

Implement the Binary Search Tree and gain experience in working with Binary Search Trees

## What you must do?

Solve the following the Binary Search Tree problems

1. **Second largest element in BST**

Given a Binary Search Tree(BST), find the second largest element.

Examples: 
```python

		Input:
		       30
		      /
		     20
		    /
		   10
		   
		Output:
		     20


		Input:
		       10
		      /   \
		    5      20
		             \ 
		              30
		Output:
		30

```

2.  **Sorted Array to Balanced BST**

Given a sorted array. Write a function that creates a Balanced Binary Search Tree using array elements.

Examples:

```python
		Input:  Array {1, 2, 3}
		Output: A Balanced BST
		     2
		   /  \
		  1    3 

		Input: Array {1, 2, 3, 4}
		Output: A Balanced BST
		      3
		    /  \
		   2    4
		 /
		1
```
