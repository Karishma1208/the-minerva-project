# Implementation of a Linked Lists

## Overview
With the basics covered, an the need for linked lists established, it is time to get out hands dirty with the implementation. This is a building block towards operations on linked lists. Once the intution is established, the operations become easier. Most interviewers usually ask candidates to logically solve problems on linked lists and implement them.

## Learning Outcomes
- Learn about the special pointer variables
- Understand how to create a list in low-level languages
- Understand the same process in Javascript
- Know why and how are they different from each Another
- Get a visual understanding of the whole process

## Introduction
Now we already know that in low-level languages, the memory is allocated dynamically to create linked lists. However, the address of the newly allocated block must be stored in a special variable so that it can not be misidentified as a regualar value. This special variable is called a pointer. They are used extensively to create blocks in memory to store the value and address of nodes in a linked list.

You will notice that Javascript does not have the funcionality of using pointers as it is a high level language and does not require memory abstraction features. The major difference in actually implemention will be that javascript will create a class and use its object as a node. However the basic structure of the node remains the same.
## What you must do
- Get an [understanding of pointers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-HBipu_1P0)
- [Detailed implementation of a singly linked list](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vcQIFT79_50&list=PL2_aWCzGMAwI3W_JlcBbtYTwiQSsOTa6P&index=5)
- Learn how to implement a [linked list in Javascript](https://humanwhocodes.com/blog/2019/01/computer-science-in-javascript-linked-list/). You may only read the initial creation section. The operations will be covered in the next topic.

## Additional Resources
- Check out [Another example for creating a list in javascript](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~adamchik/15-121/lectures/Linked%20Lists/linked%20lists.html). You may look at the insertion and deletion operations in brief. They will be covered in detail further.
