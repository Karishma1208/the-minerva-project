### Overview:

Before you start how to program the web, you must have an understanding of the working principle of web. In this topic, you will understand the ecosystem in which you will be working. 

### Learning Outcomes:  
- How the world wide web works?

- What is the difference between the web and the internet?

- What's the difference between HTTP and HTML?

- What is URL?

- What is the internet infrastructure?

### Introduction

Welcome to the very first step of your Web Development Journey.

It’s difficult to understand what web development is if you don’t have at least a general idea of how the web works.

Everytime you open a page on Chrome or Firefox, the following process happens:

*Step 1:* The web browser sends a request to a web server.(This is done through a protocol known as HTTP, or Hypertext Transfer Protocol)


*Step 2:* When the request for a particular resource: URI (Uniform Resource Identifier) is sent to a web server, that web server finds the requested content. If it exists, it sends back a response to the browser.

*Step 3:* The browser then processes that response, which is what the end user sees in the web browser.

Obviously within each step, lot of smaller operations are happening but the gist of web functioning is that the **web browser makes a request and the web server responds**. 

As an aspiring web developer knowing that is important since web applications have to continually make requests from the server for every action that happens in the application.
The role of a web developer is therefore effectively just finding ways to manage states between requests and keep track of the individual users that are using the web application simultaneously.
