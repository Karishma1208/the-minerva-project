# Basics of Sorting Algorithms

## Overview
Having learnt about searching algorithms, we move on to the second pillar of solving major programming problems. Like the former, there are multiple ways to sort an array of numbers,strings etc., each with different levels of efficiency. Sorting algorithms has widespread applications in the field.

## Learning Outcomes
- What are sorting Algorithms

- Why are some better than other
- What are the applications of sorting algorithms

## Introduction
Sorting Algorithms are those that arrange the elements of a list in any order (ascending or descending). It can help drastically reduce complexities of problems. Although most programing languages have their own built in sorting functions, it is important to know how they work to develop algorithmic thinking. We will learn some of the most common ones in this topic.<br>

The picture below summarizes the complexities of various sorting algorithms. Make sure you go through the links below and get back to compare the different algorithms. It is obvious that merge and quick sort are some of the better performing ones:<br>

## What you must do
- Get an [introduction to sorting algorithms](https://betterexplained.com/articles/sorting-algorithms/). Read bubble sort, insertion sort and merge sort carefully.
- Dive deeper into [Bubble Sort](https://www.studytonight.com/data-structures/bubble-sort). You may read the extended optimized form for extra reference.
- Dive deeper into [Insertion Sort](https://www.studytonight.com/data-structures/insertion-sorting) followed by the analysis of its complexity.
- Understand the Divide & Conquer approach in [Merge Sort](https://www.studytonight.com/data-structures/merge-sort)

## Assessment Quiz
1. A sorting technique is in place if it does not use any extra memory to sort the array.
    - True*
    - False

2. When using a stable sorting technique, what happens if there are two equal keys/value
    - The relative order is maintained
    - The relative order is not important*

3. The insertion sort algorithm improves on the selection sort method by reducing the number of comparisons.
    - True
    - False*

4. The quick sort algorithm divides the list into two sublists, then sorts each sublists, and then combines both sublists.
    - True*
    - False

5. The merge sort algorithm differs from the quick sort only in how it partitions the list, which is to create two nearly equal sublists.
    - True*
    - False

6. The following lists represent 3 passes of a sorting algorithm. Which algorithm is being used to sort the list?<br>
    4 5 9 6 2 7<br>
    4 5 6 2 7 9<br>
    4 5 2 6 7 9<br>
   - Bubble Sort*
   - Selection Sort
   - Insertion Sort

7. Consider a situation where swap operation is very costly. Which of the following sorting algorithms should be preferred so that the number of swap operations are minimized in general?
    - Heap Sort
    - Selection Sort*
    - Insertion Sort
    - Merge Sort

8. Assume that a merge sort algorithm in the worst case takes 30 seconds for an input of size 64. Which of the following most closely approximates the maximum input size of a problem that can be solved in 6 minutes?

    - 256
    - 512*
    - 1024
    - 2048
