# End-of-sprint Project: A team collaboration app

## Problem Statement

Using the concepts, you have learnt in this sprint, you will be creating a replica of Trello – a team collaboration app. 

A typical Trello page looks like this:

### Introduction to Trello:
Trello is a team collaboration application. Software engineering teams use this software to track progress of their tasks over the period of a sprint. 

A typical Trello application has **boards** related to specific aspect of development like front-end development, back-end development and so on, or it could be related to a specific story part of a software like ‘Adding the mobiles page to the e-commerce application’. The content for each board can vary from team to team. In the sample image above, we have a board for *Agile Sprint Board*.

As you can see in the image above, every board has **lists** – the vertical sections containing a lot of rectangular boxes called **cards**. Majority of the times, if the Trello board is being used for a sprint, each list corresponds to a stage in the sprint, for example: backlog, in progress, completed, tested, and so on. Each card is a task that needs to be completed for a successful end to the sprint. 

These cards can be moved from one list to another. For example, we have a task named Add post-message-io in the Backlog list. When it will be picked up by a developer, it can then be dragged and dropped in to the In Progress list. 

The small colored rectangles in every boxes are the **labels** users can add for tasks. The circular boxes in every card are the **users/developers** who are working on that task.


You have to create a replica of the Trello board. You can skip the features like Calendar, Copy Board and Public shown on the navigation bar. At the end of the assignment, you should have an application which can do the following:
1.	Sign up/login a user.

2.	Create a board.
3.	Create a list and add cards to the list.
4.	Edit or delete card(s).
5.	Functionality to create new boards.
The said application should be hosted and deployed on Firebase.
