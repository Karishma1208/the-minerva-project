#### Introduction
After drilling down what HTML is, let's learn about Cascading Style Sheets (CSS). 

Where HTML represented the content of the web page, CSS defines how that content is presented to the user. It determines things like font size, margins, and colors using a language entirely separate from HTML.

Web browsers apply CSS rules" to a document to affect how they it should look like. 

A CSS rule always start with a `"selector"` that defines which HTML elements it applies to. 

***
```css
body {
    color: #FF0000
}
```
***

In the above case, the `<body>` element is the "selector". After the selector, we have the declarations block . Any "properties"(in the above case, color is a property) we set in here will affect the `<body>` element.
