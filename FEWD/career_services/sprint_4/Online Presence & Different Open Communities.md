## Why is social media so important for career development?

Social media is important for career development because it’s such a powerful form of networking. As is inherent in the term “social networks,” channels like Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, and even Instagram have become the places to build a network of friends, fans, followers, connections, or whatever else you’d like to call them! Networking is key to career and professional development. The connections you make on social media could help you get a new job, find a mentor, learn more about your industry, support a career change, and more.
  


### What are some top tips for networking on social media?


The first step in using social media is to create a strategy. Here’s how:

 1. **Set your objectives**. Is your goal broad (network and build contacts) or narrow (get a job)? Clarify the exact call to action that you want to elicit from your activities.

2. **Identify the audience you would like to reach**. Who are you speaking to? Who is most likely to be moved by your content? These are important questions to answer, since your message — and the way you tell it — should differ based on your intended audience.

3. **Define your message.** What story are you telling? Be clear on what kind of values, problems, solutions, skills, knowledge are involved.

4. **Choose the social media platforms that make the most sense.** Different social media platforms have vastly different demographics. For example, Facebook and Instagram are more personal and intimate platforms used to connect with family and friends, and LinkedIn, GitHub are platforms whe one can showcase their professional skill sets and past work experience. Quora allows users to connect with others from their field of work and seek guidance from them on various work related topics. Decide which platforms to use by thinking about the specific objectives and intended audiences for each of your online activity or efforts. The most popular Online media platforms are LinkedIn, GitHub, medium, Quora and Twitter, so focus on those to use for professional work. .

5. **Create or compile resources and materials to share through social media.** Posting factual information or those with references to validate or back its reliability is imperative. Sharing opinions or personal perceptions, or even worse - sharing someone else’s intellectual property without consent\reference is in very poor taste. It can cause legal hassle too. Carefully create the content you want to share, (projects, blogs, personal info, etc) Across all online media outlets and share in just enough frequency to avoid overwhelming the audience. High-quality photographs and images are critical.

6. **Be genuine.** Determine the tone of your messaging. Let your personality show and use humor when appropriate. Try to speak as an individual, to individuals - be narrative in nature. This will help grant you credibility as a trusted source.

  

7. **Stay focused.** The people and organizations that follow you on social media have certain expectations about the type of content you post and the way you engage with them. If you stray too far from your objectives, you will lose the trust and attention of your community.

8. **Be Human.** This is a big one. One of the worst mistakes to make on social media is coming off as the robot with zero personality. In the modern age of transparency, people want to get to know you and your journey to your current status on a more personal level.

We know that life can get busy, but you wouldn’t shake someone’s hand and then turn around and walk away without saying anything would you? Social networking is similar; you need to have a good presentation (first impression or appearance) and then actively engage in conversations with people once you’re connected to them.

## Make Your Profile Impactful

After understanding where you should make your profiles, understand how to make **impactful** profiles

#### Story-telling

Do you remember the dates and facts from history? Maybe not all of us. But we definitely remember the stories of great rulers and events. The same experience applies to LinkedIn profiles. Weave a story. People respond to stories better than a mind-numbing list of figures and facts. Tales are easy to remember and are enduring in nature.

Hence, instead of simply state your responsibilities, curate an intriguing story about your successes in the job. Explain the problems and how you handled them creatively. Keep your narrative concise. Do not go overboard with the storytelling and writing a novel. Not all recruiters are avid readers.

#### Focus on where you are going vs. where you have been

Mid-career transitions are not uncommon. Gone are the days when you get a job, work there for your entire life and retire. In fact, a lot of professionals prefer switching companies very fast. How healthy it is depends on how soon you do it. Discussion for another day!

If you want to reinvent yourself after years of working in the same industry and domain, your LinkedIn profile should reflect where you want to go, as opposed to what/where you’ve been. Find what you want to develop your niche in, what kind of role you want to play and build your profile around that. Leverage on how your existing skills and past knowledge to showcase your worth in the new roles. It may be tempting to list all that you have done and achieved over the years, but try to redirect your focus on what’s relevant for the future. Remove all that you don’t want to be doing in the future and open space to write a new story for yourself. By all means, keep your list of achievements intact but only as long as it can add to your credibility.

The above greatly applies to people who are not looking to transition into a new industry. New roles will still require a similar kind of storyline and presentation, where the energy is focused towards your aspirations and goals instead of all that you have been doing.

#### Never say you’re seeking new opportunities

This is a debatable one. A lot of experts feel, putting ‘looking for job opportunities’ or the like, may make you look a little desperate and available. A lot of recruiters wouldn't want to check the profile of someone who is, crudely put → already out of a job. It can also be a horrible idea to update your headline as ‘Actively seeking new opportunities’ if you are employed. It will hoist a red flag in front of your current employers, unless you are serving your notice period.

On the other hand, announcing the fact that you are looking for freelance projects or consultant work can be beneficial for others to know that you are ready to share your expertise for time bound assignments.

#### Photo is your virtual handshake

Plenty of blogs and articles will tell you that putting a photo allows the recruiter to judge you on the basis of your appearance and make a decision. You may not get shortlisted because you are older in age or give out other information like marital status and the community you belong to. In that case, it is unprofessional of the recruiter to do so, and you do not want to be associated with such an environment. Digitisation has ensured ample social presence of individuals along with their pictures. Recruiters will look you up everywhere.

A lack of a LinkedIn profile photo is a big no-no. It makes your profile look odd, incomplete and suspicious. LinkedIn members who include a profile photo receive more profile views, notes Fisher. “Your photo is your virtual handshake, so upload a photo that aligns with your role as a professional, but that makes you approachable,” she adds. Keep it professional and clean. The same picture can be added to your resume to maintain continuity.

A lot of us enjoy looking young in our pictures from 10 years back but maybe limit that to Facebook. The more recent the picture, the better it is. If you’re called in for an interview, the evident age difference will immediately make the recruiting team wonder what else you may be hiding/faking. Authenticity is key.

## Summary

By now it's clear that you have to ensure you have updated online profiles. What is more important is to be active, follow the right people, support the right causes, be focused and continue to do good work. Without good quality of work, all efforts towards building the social profiles are in vain.
