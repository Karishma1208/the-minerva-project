# Operations on BST

## Overview

After understanding the concept of the Binary Search Trees, we will proceed to learn to the search, insert and deletion operations in a Binary Search Tree

BST are an extension of binary trees, so it is necessary that it also have the search, insert and deletion functionalities to be used as a data structure.

## Learning Outcome
- How to search for values in a Binary Search Trees
- How to insert values in Binary Search Trees?
- How to delete values from Binary Search Trees?
## Introduction

In Binary Search trees, there are an order than the left node is lesser than the parent node and the right node is greater than the parent node, this enables to algorithms to be more efficient and easier to implement than Binary trees because when one is searching the location to insert or delete a certain value, the direction of the traversal is not in question due to structure of a Binary Search tree.

## What you must do?

Study how to [search and insert for Binary Search Trees](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/binary-search-tree-set-1-search-and-insertion/) 

Learn how to [delete values from a Binary Search Trees](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/binary-search-tree-set-2-delete/) 

Review the [traversal techniques for the trees](https://www.codingeek.com/data-structure/tree-traversal-bfs-and-dfs-introduction-explanation-and-implementation/) once again

Study the implementation of [Binary Search tree in Javascript](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/implementation-binary-search-tree-javascript/)

## Assessment Quiz
- What is the worst case time complexity for search, insert and delete operations in a general Binary Search Tree?
**-- O(n) for all**
-- O(Logn) for all
-- O(Logn) for search and insert, and O(n) for delete
-- O(Logn) for search, and O(n) for insert and delete

- In delete operation of BST, we need inorder successor (or predecessor) of a node when the node to be deleted has both left and right child as non-empty. Which of the following is true about inorder successor needed in delete operation?
-- Inorder Successor is always a leaf node
**-- Inorder successor is always either a leaf node or a node with empty left child**
-- Inorder successor may be an ancestor of the node
-- Inorder successor is always either a leaf node or a node with empty right child


- Which of the following traversal outputs the data in sorted order in a BST?
-- Preorder
**-- Inorder**
-- Postorder
-- Level order

- Suppose the numbers 7, 5, 1, 8, 3, 6, 0, 9, 4, 2 are inserted in that order into an initially empty binary search tree. The binary search tree uses the usual ordering on natural numbers. What is the in-order traversal sequence of the resultant tree?
-- 7 5 1 0 3 2 4 6 8 9
-- 0 2 4 3 1 6 5 9 8 7
**-- 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9**
-- 9 8 6 4 2 3 0 1 5 7

- The following numbers are inserted into an empty binary search tree in the given order: 10, 1, 3, 5, 15, 12, 16. What is the height of the binary search tree (the height is the maximum distance of a leaf node from the root)?
-- 2
**-- 3**
-- 4
-- 6
