# Sprint 7: Interview Prep


## Overview
In the previous sprints, we have learnt the concepts of Front End Developement to proficiency. In the next two sprints we will look at developing a foundation to tackle the most common topics asked in interviews.

Data Structures and Algorithms form the bedrock of Computer Science. It can be used to assess the problem solving skills and algorithmic thinking of the candidate. We will pick up from the basics learnt in sprint 3 and solve more complex problems.

This sprint will be more hands-on and will require constant rigor. The key to mastering DSA is <b>Practice! Practice! Practice! </b>

## Pre requisites
We will code predominently in javascript. A good level of fluency is required to understand the algorithms. Mastering the basics covered in sprint 3 is necessary to proceed further.

## Learning Outcomes
- Understand the implementation of the most common Data Structures and Algorithm Paradigms.
- Create strategies to solve competetive coding challenges.
- Implement the strategies using javascript.

## What will you be doing ?

- Understand the basics of Data Structures and Algorithms
- Solve problems based on the following algorithm classes:
  - Searching Algorithms
  - Sorting algorithms
- Solve problems based on the following Data Structures:
  - Linked List
  - Stacks
  - Queues
