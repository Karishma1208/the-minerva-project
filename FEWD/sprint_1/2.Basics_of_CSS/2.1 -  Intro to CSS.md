## Overview

In the late ‘90s, HTML coders noticed that they were retyping the same old tags again and again on the same page, leading to bigger HTML files and above all, it was time consuming and frustrating.Adding in mountains of `<font>` tags, despite wanting them all the same; or using tricks like invisible gifs for spacing.

Then, w3c came up with an idea: have **one file** that defines all the values that those piles of tags would have done, and then have all your pages checking this file and formatting your pages accordingly. You can therefore leave most of the formatting tags (e.g. `em`, `i`, `strong`) **separating structure and presentation**.

This section will introduce you to basic building blogs of CSS and it's selectors and properties.

### What is CSS?



In late 1996 CSS (Cascading StyleSheets) became a reality, forged by our good friends the [» World Wide Web Consortium](http://www.w3.org/ 'Get to know the W3C a little better...') (W3C). Your stylesheet acts as a partner to your HTML code; taking care of all the layout, fonts, colours and overall _look_ of your site.

If you ever decide to change the look of your site, you modify that one CSS file (your _style sheet_) and **all the HTML pages reading from that file will display differently**. This makes maintenance of your design _much_ easier.

### Benefits of CSS

- **Pages download faster**, sometimes by as much as 50%
- You have to type less code, and your pages are shorter and neater.
- The look of your site is kept consistent throughout all the pages that work off the same stylesheet.
- Updating your design and general site maintenance are made much easier, and errors caused by editing multiple HTML pages occur far less often.

### CSS Selectors, Properties and Values

A **CSS** rule-set consists of a **selector** and a declaration block: The **selector** points to the HTML element you want to style. The declaration block contains one or more declarations separated by semicolons. Each declaration includes a **CSS property** name and a value, separated by a colon.

#### What you must do?

- Learn [how to apply CSS](https://www.htmldog.com/guides/css/beginner/applyingcss/). Though we have already learnt it, it would be a good revision. Avoid Inline CSS as it's always recommended to add CSS to the css file so that we can maintain HTML and CSS separately.
- Read about the [CSS Selectors, Properties and Values](https://www.htmldog.com/guides/css/beginner/selectors/). HTML is known by Tags and CSS is known by Selctors, Properties and Values.
- A CSS selector is the part of a CSS rule set that actually selects the content you want to style. Let’s look at all the different kinds of selectors available, with a brief description of each. [various types of selectors](https://www.sitepoint.com/css-selectors/)
- If you have two (or more) conflicting CSS rules that point to the same element, there are some basic rules that a browser follows to determine which one is most specific and therefore wins out. Read about [precedence and specificity of CSS selectors](https://www.htmldog.com/guides/css/intermediate/specificity/)
