# Software Development Life Cycle

## Overview

In the previous topic, we touched upon the basic work flow that every web development process has to go through. This flow is a part of a bigger process that is followed by every software development team across the globe. 

This flow is called as the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) 
Learning this is an important step in understanding how to build an app in a timely and successfull way 

## Learning Outcome

-   What is SDLC?
- 	Why is SDLC so important for development?
- 	What are the different types of SDLC?
- 	What are the different processes involved in SDLC?


## Introduction

For every software(in our case, a web application) to be widely accepted by the consumers and clients alike, it's incredibly important to ensure its quality and efficiency. Software Development Life Cycle (or popularly known as SDLC) defines a set of steps that take the software from inception to completion. It entails all the tasks from planning, developing, testing, and deployment of software.
Based on the product and the team size involved, there are different methodologies or types of SDLC to be followed.

A typical SDLC consists of Requirement Analysis, Design, Implementation, Testing and Evolution

What you must do?

-  Understand about [various steps involved in SDLC](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sdlc/sdlc_overview.htm) that you just read about. 

- Though the basic steps(Req. Analysis to Evolution) remain the same, lot of different implementations of these steps exist. Learn about the [different methodologies of SDLC.](https://melsatar.blog/2012/03/15/software-development-life-cycle-models-and-methodologies/). Pay special attention to the 'Agile Method', its one of the most preferred methodologies by web developers.
