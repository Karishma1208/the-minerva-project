## Overview

Now that we know about the properties of Binary trees, its implementation and the different types.
We want to access/retrieve the data that has been stored in the binary tree.

## Learning Outcome

- How to traverse through a binary tree and access its data?
- Understanding different approaches of traversal
- Advantages and disadvantages of different traversal techniques

## Introduction

Binary trees are non linear data structures, this allows to different techniques to traverse through the tree and access the data stored in it.

**Tree traversal**  is the process of visiting each node in the tree exactly once. Visiting each node in a graph should be done in a systematic manner. If search result in a visit to all the vertices, it is called a traversal. There are basically four traversal techniques for a binary tree that are,

1. Preorder traversal
2. Inorder traversal
3. Postorder traversal
4. Level Order traversal

## Assessment Quiz
- Which of the following sequences denotes the post order traversal sequence of the given tree?

         a
       /   \ 
      b     e
      /    /
      c   d  f
      /
      g
  -- f e g c d b a
  -- g c b d a f e
  **-- g c d b f e a**
  -- f e d g c b a

- The in-order and pre-order traversal of a binary tree are d b e a f c g and a b d e c f g respectively. The post order traversal of a binary tree is
-- e d b g f c a
-- e d b f g c a
**-- d e b f g c a**
-- d e f g b c a

- What is common in three different types of traversals (Inorder, Preorder and Postorder)?
-- Root is visited before right subtree
**-- Left subtree is always visited before right subtree**
-- Root is visited after left subtree
-- All of the above
-- None of the above

- Which traversal of tree resembles the breadth first search of the graph?
-- Preorder
-- Inorder
-- Postorder
**-- Level order**

- The in-order traversal of a tree resulted in FBGADCE. Then the pre-order traversal of that tree would result in
-- FGBDECA
**-- ABFGCDE**
-- BFGCDEA
-- AFGBDEC
