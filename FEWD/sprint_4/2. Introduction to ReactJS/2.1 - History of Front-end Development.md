# History of Front-end Development

After thoroughly understanding the web development workflow, let's begin our journey into `React JS`

**Why this concept?**

This entire concept will focus on helping you understand about the advancement in front end technolgies and what problems they helped solve.

Our focus will then shift towards ReactJS and the reason for its inception. 
By the end of the concept, we will be able to **`Write our First ReactJS code`** and create a similar 'About Me' page given below:

***Note:*** The above page might seem underwhelming, given that you have already created something similar in your foundation course(Sprint 0). The difference here is that you are taking the help of ReactJS (*Isn't that exciting?*) 



## Overview

In this topic, we will begin from the beginning i.e. take a deep-dive into the history of front-end development.

## Learning Outcome
-	An acute understanding of what were the technologies used before ReactJS.
-	Advantages and disadvantages of the formerly used technologies.

## Introduction

To understand(and appreciate) ReactJS framework, we need to first understand how the earlier technologies shaped the journey of front-end development from mere HTML + CSS to an interactive ReactJS environment.

## What you must do?

-	Read the entire [front end development journey](https://espeo.eu/blog/front-end-history-2018-trends-and-espeo-choices/) which talks about the history of front-end development from mere HTML+CSS pages to ReactJS and SPAs.

-	Next, read about [jQuery – a JavaScript library](https://www.c-sharpcorner.com/article/javascript-vs-jquery-difference-between-javascript-and-jquery/) created to simplify HTML manipulation and traversal. The link also helps you understand the advantages of jQuery over vanilla JavaScript.

-	While jQuery greatly simplified writing code, any event change still caused the entire webpage to be reloaded. That’s where AJAX came into picture. Read how [AJAX changed the game](https://www.seguetech.com/ajax-technology/)


-	Post jQuery and jQuery AJAX, the next big revolution came with the [web framework AngularJS](https://www.codeclouds.com/blog/jquery-vs-angularjs/)(Think of it as an elder brother of ReactJS). Complement the previous read by understanding the [advantages and disadvantages of AngularJS](https://jaxenter.com/the-pros-and-cons-of-choosing-angularjs-124850.html)
