# Concept 6: Redux, Testing and Optimization

## Introduction

In the previous concept, you were introduced to a host of concepts in advanced React like Fragments, HOCs, Error Boundaries, CSS Modules. Moreover, you also learnt how to create the MPA effect in an SPA using react-router. In this concept, we will move a step further and resolve the problems faced by passing props from parents to nth-child and vice-versa by introducing Redux - a stand-alone library that in conjunction with React gives you the concept of a global store. We will then move to creating applications and components using TDD - Test Driven Development with Jest and Enzyme. Finally, we will finish the concept by learning about optimization in React.

## Learning Objectives

In this sprint, we will be concentrating on learning a few more important concepts in React. However, to comprehend the concepts you will be learning in this sprint, you need to be thorough with the following:

- What are components and what are the different types of components?

- How are props passed from a parent component to a child component?

- How to pass props from a child component to a parent component?

- What are the different lifecycle methods for a stateful component?

- How to fetch data from the web and update components using the fetched data?

- How to switch pages using react-router and what are ```history, props and location```?

If you are still not comfortable with these concepts, have a quick glance at the above mentioned topics in Sprint 4 and Sprint 5. 


At the end of this sprint, you will learn the following:

- How to resolve the problem of passing props between multi-levels of components?

- How to have a global store accessible to all the components?

- When to use the component state and when to use the global store?

- What is TDD (Test Driven Development) and why is it crucial for certain development?

- How to optimize the React application to improve its efficiency?

## What will you be able to build?


- 'Weather Application'

You will also be modifying your 'Weather Application'(Sprint 5) as coding assessment using the new concepts you will learn in this sprint.

In this app, you will be:
- Implementing "Principles of Redux" to optimise the app further
- Recreate app component using Test Driven Development(TDD)


If you are stuck in between, you can refer to the complete solution of the project [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Vz5sE-WSGU0IXFlJ1NydmQ9lMdXGlhlu/view?usp=sharing)

- Sprint Project: Team Collaboration App

At the end of this sprint, you will be converting the Pro-Organizer application that you've created in the Sprint 5 to a React+Redux application. It will allow you easier and better control over the component state and data. You will add a couple of new features and you will be using TDD to create this.

# Details to be added

By the end of the sprint, you should be able to build a Team Colloboration App with the following functionalities:
