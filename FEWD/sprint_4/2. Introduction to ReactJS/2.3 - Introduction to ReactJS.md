Let's start with the introduction to ReactJS



## Learning Outcome

-	What is ReactJS?

-	Why is it the most preferred library for front-end development?

-	How does ReactJS function?

## Introduction

In the previous topic, we saw how the introduction of Single Page Applications resolved the unnecessary download of resources involved in traditional Multi Page Applications. While AngularJS led from the front in the SPA revolution, it’s steep learning curve and data binding for updating the DOM was still resented by a vast majority of the front-end development community.

That’s when Facebook Inc. developed a light-weight library called ReactJS which inclines towards component reusability, east data flow and virtual DOM creation(The terms might be confusing now but they will be clear soon)
