# Organization and team structure in a web development product team


Before deep diving into React, let's take small detour to understand more about web development.

**Why this concept?**

This entire concept will focus on improving your knowledge about web development product team and the methodologies used.

At the end of the concept, we will do a team building assignment that will give you a first hand experience about the app building process in the corporate world! 


## Overview

This topic will help you understand what a typical web development product team looks like and how every individual unit collectively contributes to helping build the application.

Knowing this will go a long way in being an efficient web developer

## Learning Outcomes

-	What are the different units that make up a web development team?
-	What roles do each of the units have in completion of the project?
-	How are the units dependent on each other?
-	What is the flow of the work from beginning to the end?
-	How are each of the units involved in the process flow?

## Introduction

Same way a train is only as good as it's wheels, A web app is only as good as the people making it. 

The first step to working as a team is to understand the team structure and what are the expectations associated with each role.


A typical web development team is headed by a product manager who oversees all the work. The team is then branched out into different units as described by the chart below.

If the budget allows, each of these units are typically led by an individual called team lead whose primary job is to overlook the work done by the particular unit and convey the results with his/her reporting manager – the product manager. A basic web development team always includes these four important units. 

However, depending on the industry targeted or the theme of the product, you might also find a content writer, a marketing team and such other units added to this team structure.
