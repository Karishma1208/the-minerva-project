# Basics of Sorting Algorithms

## Overview
Having learnt about searching algorithms, we move on to the second pillar of solving major programming problems. Like the former, there are multiple ways to sort an array of numbers,strings etc., each with different levels of efficiency. Sorting algorithms has widespread applications in the field.

## Learning Outcomes
- What are sorting Algorithms
- What types of sorting algortihms exist
- Why are some better than other
- What are the applications of sorting algorithms

## Introduction
Sorting Algorithms are those that arrange the elements of a list in any order (ascending or descending). It can help drastically reduce complexities of problems. Although most programing languages have their own built in sorting functions, it is important to know how they work to develop algorithmic thinking. We will learn some of the most common ones in this topic.<br>

The picture below summarizes the complexities of various sorting algorithms. Make sure you go through the links below and get back to compare the different algorithms. It is obvious that merge and quick sort are some of the better performing ones:<br>

## What you must do
- Get an [introduction to sorting algorithms](https://betterexplained.com/articles/sorting-algorithms/). Read bubble sort, insertion sort and merge sort carefully.
- Dive deeper into [Bubble Sort](https://www.studytonight.com/data-structures/bubble-sort). You may read the extended optimized form for extra reference.
- Dive deeper into [Insertion Sort](https://www.studytonight.com/data-structures/insertion-sorting) followed by the analysis of its complexity.
- Understand the Divide & Conquer approach in [Merge Sort](https://www.studytonight.com/data-structures/merge-sort)
