**2. Convert a Binary Tree into its Mirror Tree**
Mirror of a Tree: Mirror of a Binary Tree T is another Binary Tree M(T) with left and right children of all non-leaf nodes interchanged. [Click here for solution](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/write-an-efficient-c-function-to-convert-a-tree-into-its-mirror-tree/)

**3. Sorted Linked List to Balanced BST**
Given a Singly Linked List which has data members sorted in ascending order. Construct a  Balanced Binary Search Tree which has same data members as the given Linked List. [Click here for solution](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/sorted-linked-list-to-balanced-bst/)

**4. Find a pair with given sum in BST**
Given a  BST and a sum, find if there is a pair with given sum. [Click here for solution](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/find-a-pair-with-given-sum-in-bst/)

**5. Find the largest BST subtree in a given Binary Tree**
Given a Binary Tree, write a function that returns the size of the largest subtree which is also a Binary Search Tree (BST). If the complete Binary Tree is BST, then return the size of whole tree.

### Algorithms

**1. Count ways to build street under given constraints**
There is a street of length n and as we know it has two sides. Therefore a total of 2 * n spots are available. In each of these spots either a house or an office can be built with following 2 restrictions:
	1. No two offices on the same side of the street can be adjacent.
	2. No two offices on different sides of the street can be exactly opposite to each other i.e. they can’t overlook each other.
	There are no restrictions on building houses and each spot must either have a house or office.
	Given length of the street n, find total number of ways to build the street.

**2. Count the number of ways to traverse a Matrix**
Given a two-dimensional matrix, in how way can someone traverse it from top-left to bottom-right?
Condition- At any particular cell the possible moves are either down or right, no other steps possible.

Stop when the end is reached. [Click here for solution](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/count-the-number-of-ways-to-traverse-a-matrix/)

**3. Minimum Number of Platforms Required for a Railway/Bus Station**
Given arrival and departure times of all trains that reach a railway station, the task is to find the minimum number of platforms required for the railway station so that no train waits.
We are given two arrays which represent arrival and departure times of trains that stop

	Input: arr[] = {9:00, 9:40, 9:50, 11:00, 15:00, 18:00}
	dep[] = {9:10, 12:00, 11:20, 11:30, 19:00, 20:00}
	Output: 3
	There are at-most three trains at a time (time between 11:00 to 11:20)

**4. Dice Throw**
Given n dice each with m faces, numbered from 1 to m, find the number of ways to get sum X. X is the summation of values on each face when all the dice are thrown. [Click here for solution](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dice-throw-dp-30/)

**5. Write a program to calculate pow(x,n)**
Given two integers x and n, write a function to compute xn. We may assume that x and n are small and overflow doesn’t happen. [Click here for solution](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/write-a-c-program-to-calculate-powxn/)

### Strings

1. Write an efficient program to print all permutations of a given String in any programming language of your choice. [Click here for solution]()

2. Write an efficient function that takes two strings as arguments and removes the characters from the first string, which are present in the second string. [Click here for solution]()

3. Write an efficient program to return the maximum occurring character in the input string, e.g., if the input string is "Java" then the function should return 'a'. [Click here for solution]()

4. Given a string containing just the characters '(', ')', '{', '}', '[' and ']', write a function to check if the input string is valid. The brackets must close in the correct order, "()" and "()[]{}" are all valid but "(]" and "([)]" are not. [Click here for solution]()

5. Build a function which checks the following password parameters:
	-   Password should contain uppercase and lowercase letters.
	-   Password should contain letters and numbers.
	-   Password should contain special characters.
	-   Minimum length of the password (the default value is 8).
