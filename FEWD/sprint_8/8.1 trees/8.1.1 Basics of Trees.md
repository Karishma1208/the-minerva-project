## Overview

We have explored linear data structures and their properties till now. Now as the data gets bigger, performing operations in linear data structure can start getting slow and tedious. So the need for non linear structures arises.

As we know questions on algorithms and data structures are common in interviews and with different algorithms being related to Trees, it is very important to be very precise in one's knowledge of Trees and its concepts

## Learning Outcome

- What are trees?
- How are trees different from other data structures?
- Why are trees non linear data structures?

## Introduction

We have learnt Linked Lists, Queues, and Stacks, these data structures are all called _linear_ data structures because they all have a logical start and a logical end.
The data is ordered, and that order matters; the way that you traverse a linear data structure is directly related to its order, because the elements in a linear data structure can only be traversed _sequentially_.

When we start learning trees, it gets really confusing. Trees are well known as a non-linear Data Structure. It doesn’t store data in a linear way. It organizes data in a hierarchical way.

The data doesn’t really follow an order — at least, not an obvious numerical one, like with arrays or linked lists. And because the data doesn’t necessarily need to be arranged in a particular order, it’s easy (and actually pretty common) to traverse a non-linear data structure in a _non-sequential_ manner.
