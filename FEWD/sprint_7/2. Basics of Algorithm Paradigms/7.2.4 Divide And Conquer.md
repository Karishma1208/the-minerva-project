# Divide And Conquer algorithms

## Overview

Having understood the greedy approach, we discussed that it may not be able to solve all problems. These problems can recursively be broken down into two or more sub problems of the same type, until they become simple enough to be solved directly. This approach is called Divide And Conquer.
## Learning Outcomes

- Understand the Divide And Conquer Approach
- Identify problems that can be solved using this method
- Understand the intuition behind a few example problems

## Introduction

The story of the old man gives a perfectly intuitive understanding of the D&Q method. There was an old, rich farmer with seven sons. He was afraid that upon his death, his possessions would be divided amongst his sons, and that they would quarrel with one another.

So he gathered them together and showed them seven sticks that he had tied together and told them
that anyone who could break the bundle would inherit everything. They all tried, but no one could
break the bundle. Then the old man untied the bundle and broke the sticks one by one. The brothers decided that they should stay together and work together and succeed together. The moral for problem solvers is different. If we canâ€™t solve the problem, divide it into parts, and solve one part at a time.

The recusive problems we saw before are all part of the D&Q domain.
