# Operations on BST

## Overview

After understanding the concept of the Binary Search Trees, we will proceed to learn to the search, insert and deletion operations in a Binary Search Tree

BST are an extension of binary trees, so it is necessary that it also have the search, insert and deletion functionalities to be used as a data structure.

## Learning Outcome
- How to search for values in a Binary Search Trees
- How to insert values in Binary Search Trees?
- How to delete values from Binary Search Trees?
## Introduction

In Binary Search trees, there are an order than the left node is lesser than the parent node and the right node is greater than the parent node, this enables to algorithms to be more efficient and easier to implement than Binary trees because when one is searching the location to insert or delete a certain value, the direction of the traversal is not in question due to structure of a Binary Search tree.

## What you must do?

Study how to [search and insert for Binary Search Trees](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/binary-search-tree-set-1-search-and-insertion/) 

Learn how to [delete values from a Binary Search Trees](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/binary-search-tree-set-2-delete/) 

Review the [traversal techniques for the trees](https://www.codingeek.com/data-structure/tree-traversal-bfs-and-dfs-introduction-explanation-and-implementation/) once again
