## What did you learn?

By now, you should have a good understanding of the asynchronous operations oin JS and the beauty of external libraries like jQuery and lodash.

At the end of this concept, you render a list of quiz question with the options and allow user to select the answer.

## Key take-aways

- You can use libraries like jQuery and lodash
- You have a clear understanding of AJAX
- You have learnt the basics of events, event loop and event delegation


## Coding Practice

In this assignment, we would want you retrieve data related to the quiz from another platform.

## Your Tasks

### Task 1

In your code, make an api call to  
[https://opentdb.com/api.php?amount=10&category=11&difficulty=easy&type=multiple](https://opentdb.com/api.php?amount=10&category=11&difficulty=easy&type=multiple)

The API provides you with the dummy data of quiz questions and answers.

### Task 2

Show a stylised list of 10 quiz questions. Style it as per your creativity. Make sure you add some elements of delight like hover effect, animation on selecting an answer, etc. to brush your knowledge on CSS animation.

### Input

API call that provides 10 quiz questions

### Output

Retrieve the list and render the questions and answers

### Constraints

- API call should be made using `fetch()` api
- Use jQuery for DOM manipulation



## How will it help the project?

Since, you have learnt the basics of AJAX and jQuery, you can use it for fetchinng the data from the news API using either fetch or jQuery AJAX. You can use lodash to manipulate the result retrieved from the API.

Next, you'd learn some of the advanced concepts of JavaScript.
