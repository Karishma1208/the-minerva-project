# Sprint 2 - Responsive Web Design

Congratulations on completing Sprint 1!

In Sprint 2, you'll learn about Responsive Web Design. If you want to become a Web developer, this is the skillset you need to hone in this era. Most of the Web application/sites being built today are responsive unless it's a complex dashboard that has a lot of elements which cannot be resized to fit on smaller devices. Consider this an extension of the previous sprint as most of the topics we have covered previously will be utilized in this sprint.

After successfully completing this sprint, you'll be building the Zomato: Landing Page. Excited? ;)
