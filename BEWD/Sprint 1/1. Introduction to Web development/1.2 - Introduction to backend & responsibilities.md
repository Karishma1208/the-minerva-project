### Introduction
- Back-end developers work with front-end developers by giving the outward facing web app elements of server-side logic. In other words, back-end devâ€™s create the business logic to make the web app work correctly, and they achieve this through the use of back end scripting languages. Some of the regular responsibilities include
	- Writing server-side code
	- Interacting with database
	- Writing code to communicate with the database
	- Deploying the system online so the app can be usable
	- Maintaining security of the code
	- Maintaining code to be optimised to handle large traffic volume
	- Integrating server-side logic with front end
	- Design and implementation of data storage solutions
	- Building reusable code and libraries for future use
	- Writing documentation for ease of use for new developers
- Back-end developers usually work in groups or teams. Within larger organisations, there can be both back-end and front-end engineers, which can include - engineers with specific roles like REST API developers or quality assurance or architects.
