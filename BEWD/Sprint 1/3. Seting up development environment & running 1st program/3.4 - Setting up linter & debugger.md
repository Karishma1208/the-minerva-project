### Overview

This sections introduces you to linter & debuggers which is a must for each developer. Also helps you understand purpose of linting & debugging your code and walks you through the process of setting it up and utilizing the same to ease development.

### Introduction
- Linter
	- What is linting?
		- Lint, or a linter, is a tool that analyzes source code to flag programming errors, bugs, stylistic errors, and suspicious constructs.
		- Simply put, a linter is a tool that programmatically scans your code with the goal of finding issues that can lead to bugs or inconsistencies with code health and style. Some can even help fix them for you!
	- How is this actually helping or why should I care?
		- Probably the biggest overlying theme of the list above is the fact that these issues will be called out immediately. No longer will these issues creep up on you in the middle of running your app or give someone anxiety during a code review. No longer will you and your reviewer endlessly fight passive aggressively through the comments about whether or not to include a semicolon at the end of JS statements.
		- All of those moments that stop you from being productive because of a silly syntax error or the micro-interactions you and your teammates have during a review take time. They add up and end up taking away the time you can spend fixing another bug or developing the next great feature of your product.

- Debugger
	- Node.js debugging doesn’t have to be the headache it was in the past.
	- It doesn’t need to involve 500 console.log()s (printing at each point) in the codebase to figure out where the bug is.
	- Debugger makes life of a developer easy in lot many ways and makes maintaining code easy as well.
