# Basics of Database Management

## Overview

In this section, we will study the basics of database management and build a base for further exploration and learning.
Yet again, this is another concept which is quite distanced from frontend frameworks and website building, but it is an important chunk which is frequently discussed during interviews.

## Learning Outcome

- What is a database?
- What comprises a database management system?
- What is the need of a DBMS?

## Introduction

Database management is one of the most essential part of a computing system, it is involved with storing, retrieving data which forms the backbone of all computing operations.

In the digital age, data is the new oil. It is seen as one of the most important assets of an organisation; it is the foundation of information and the basis on which people make decisions.
Hence it would follow that if the data is accurate, complete, organised and consistent, it will contribute to the growth of the organisation. And in case of the opposite, it would become a very big liability; bad organisation of data can lead to making harmful decisions because ofincomplete information. In addition, the amount of data connected to an organisation today is on an unprecedented scale and impossible to process manually; this is why it is important to invest in an effective data management system.
