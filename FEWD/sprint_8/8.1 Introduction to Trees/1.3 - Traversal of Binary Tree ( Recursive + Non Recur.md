# Traversal of Binary Tree ( Recursive + Non Recursive )

## Overview

Now that we know about the properties of Binary trees, its implementation and the different types.
We want to access/retrieve the data that has been stored in the binary tree.

## Learning Outcome

- How to traverse through a binary tree and access its data?
- Understanding different approaches of traversal
- Advantages and disadvantages of different traversal techniques

## Introduction

Binary trees are non linear data structures, this allows to different techniques to traverse through the tree and access the data stored in it.

**Tree traversal**  is the process of visiting each node in the tree exactly once. Visiting each node in a graph should be done in a systematic manner. If search result in a visit to all the vertices, it is called a traversal. There are basically four traversal techniques for a binary tree that are,

1. Preorder traversal
2. Inorder traversal
3. Postorder traversal
4. Level Order traversal
