## Assessment Quiz
- Which of the following sequences denotes the post order traversal sequence of the given tree?

         a
       /   \ 
      b     e
      /    /
      c   d  f
      /
      g
  -- f e g c d b a
  -- g c b d a f e
  -- g c d b f e a
  -- f e d g c b a

- The in-order and pre-order traversal of a binary tree are d b e a f c g and a b d e c f g respectively. The post order traversal of a binary tree is
-- e d b g f c a
-- e d b f g c a
-- d e b f g c a
-- d e f g b c a

- What is common in three different types of traversals (Inorder, Preorder and Postorder)?
-- Root is visited before right subtree
-- Left subtree is always visited before right subtree
-- Root is visited after left subtree
-- All of the above
-- None of the above

- Which traversal of tree resembles the breadth first search of the graph?
-- Preorder
-- Inorder
-- Postorder
-- Level order

- The in-order traversal of a tree resulted in FBGADCE. Then the pre-order traversal of that tree would result in
-- FGBDECA
-- ABFGCDE
-- BFGCDEA
-- AFGBDEC
