# Sprint 8: Interview Preparation

## Overview
In the previous sprint, we studied about the different Computer Science Fundamentals - algorithms, data structures and sorting.
In sprint 8, we will continue studying more data structures, examples for algorithms we studied and other basic computing concepts.

## Pre requisites

- Knowledge of any programming language(Javascript or another other language is okay!) It will come handy while implementing different data structures and algorithms
- Good grasp on the concepts of time and space complexity and topics explored in sprint 7

## Learning Outcomes

After this sprint, you will have learnt

- What are trees, binary trees and binary search trees?
- How to search, insert and delete data from tree based data structures?
- Different examples of greedy, divide and conquer and dynamic programming
- Operating systems, their role and different types
- Database management and their role in computing
- How to use SQL to work with data in a database
- Computer networks and their different components


## Further Reading
You can read about [advanced tree based data structures](https://stackoverflow.com/a/2200588/12323766) after you complete this sprint. Reading this before completion and having solid grasp of the spring 8 concepts will be of no use.
