### HTML Typography?

Usually, we use css to style the content. But, HTML provides us wth some in built elements to style the text like we do in any other editor.

#### What you must do?

- Please go through the [link](http://www.tizag.com/htmlT/htmltext.php) to know how you can render headings and paragraphs.
- [A guide to the text formatting tags available in HTML](http://www.simplehtmlguide.com/text.php)
- Though the previous link provides an extensive useful list, [in this post you will find few other formatting tags](https://www.javatpoint.com/html-formatting). You can skip the repetetive tags that you have already read about.

### HTML Images

Images can improve the design and the appearance of a web page. Images beautify as well as depict many complex concepts in a simpler way on the web page.

#### What you must do?

- Read about how to [render images using the `<img />` tag](https://ryanstutorials.net/html-tutorial/html-images.php) and the attributes that can be applied to the image tag.

### HTML Style

Though we can style the elements using CSS, they have to be linked with HTML for the styles to be applied.

In our unit covering HTML, if any of the course material asks you to style any element (e.g HTML Table `<table></table>`) use any of the options suggested in the link for practice purposes although we would be covering it in great detail in this sprint later on while learning CSS.

#### What you must do?

### Summary

In this unit, we learnt how to format texts using HTML elements, rendering images and applying style.

While working on the assignment, you would come across situations where you would have to **style texts and render images**. If you get stuck, remember to go through this unit once again. Look at the image of the UI you'd be building for the final project. You'd see texts and images that'd would have to render while building the webpage.
