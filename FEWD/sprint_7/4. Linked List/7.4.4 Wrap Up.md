# Wrap Up

## What you learnt
We started of with why Linked lists are required in low level languages and then proceeded to how memory access works. We saw the difference between arrays in languages like C++ and Javascript. Then we digged into the implementation. We looked at the basic operations and their runtime costs. More importantly, we learnt how to visualize operations that break and create links. Finally we solved a few crucial problems that are almost always asked in interviews.

## Key Takeaways
- Arrays in low-level languages are static, i.e. the length is predecided.
- To store inputs with unknown lengths, memory is dynamically allocated as needed and linked lists are created.
- Languages like javascript have inbuilt support of these in regular arrays and hence the length dosent have to specified at the beginning.
- A linked list is an abstract data type, that stores a value and an address in a unit called as a node. The later part stores the address of the next node creating a chain.
- In low-level languages that require such functionality, addresses are stored in special pointer variables to prevent ambiguity.
- A singly linked list is one which has just one link pointing froward. A doubly linked lists has two nodes that point both forward and backward.
- The search, insertion and deletion costs are of the order of O(n).
