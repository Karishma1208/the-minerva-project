## A Day in the life of a Front End Engineer

By Rahul Shetty(Senior Software Engineer/Consultant (FrontEnd) - HERE Technologies)

**Note:** _In the following article, you might be a little confused on certain tools/ methods that a FE uses. You will get more clarity on that once you go through Sprint 4. The following article is supposed to give you a good introductory insight and it's suggested that you go through it again after you finish Sprint 4._


### How is a Day in the life of a Front-End Engineer?

Let me start by saying that, A Day in the Life of, is a misnomer. It's a Half-day in the life of a FE Engineer. A whole day would be intense, inconvenient, not to mention - unacceptable.

Frontend developers work either within companies or at specific web design agencies. Sometimes, they also work as freelancers. Job roles may therefore vary according to this, and also according to the size of the company or agency. For example, in smaller companies, front-end developers will frequently interact with other team members and may take on multiple roles. In larger companies, they may focus on only what's supposed to be achieved.


### Walk us through a typical work day from your life?

My work schedule is typically far from routine, because I'm often solving problems as they arise. Schedules and deadlines can however apply to big projects. Here is an example of a work day in my lifeâ€¦ life of a front-end web developer:

**10am :** This is the best time to get some peace and quiet, and gives me the chance to get organized for the day ahead. I spend about 45 minutes sifting through my emails and Slack messages. I'm a zero-inbox person, so the only emails in my inbox are open tasks that I need to work on or respond to - everything else is archived. I'll then check for errors and bug reports to see if any issues cropped up while I was gone, and prioritize my to-do list accordingly.

**10.45am :** Time to grab a coffee before our team meeting. Each morning we get together for an hour or so to discuss our weekly sprint goals. We talk about what we did the day before, what we'll focus on for the day ahead, and any obstacles we're currently facing. This allows us to make sure we're on track as a team and to plan the rest of the week.

**11.45am :** Now the real work begins. With the first meeting out the way, I'll get stuck into my high priority tasks. This might be something left over from the day before, or an urgent bug that needs fixing. In the absence of emergencies, I simply make a start on my to-do list. We use a project management tool called JIRA for agile planning and time tracking, so I'll get the next project from JIRA and start tracking my time. At this point, I tend to stick my headphones on and work independently to a bit of music.

We also practice pair programming, so depending on the task at hand, I might sit with one of the other developers so we can work on it together. This is a fairly common practice in the web development industry, and basically enables us to pool our knowledge and brainpower to find the best solutions.

Once I'm done with a task, I submit my code for review. I upload it to the testing server and to GitHub with a comment on what I've done and why, any changes I have made and instructions on how to test it. I'll then mark it for review so that my team sees. We operate a policy whereby all code has to be reviewed by at least one other team member, so that's what this step is for. Once I've submitted my code for review, I'll stop time tracking in Ora (another project management and time tracking software) and move that task to the QA column.

**1pm :** By now I'm pretty hungry and ready for a break, so we all head out for lunch. I prefer to step out for lunch as I think it's really important to get out of the office and interrupt the workflow for a bit. Allows me to refresh my mind and break the monotony. We talk politics, philosophy, bitcoin and family life over burgers before heading back to the office.

**2pm :** After lunch, I grab my second hit of caffeine before the next round of meetings begins. At 2pm, we meet with the design team for a project handover. They present their UI designs, walking us through everything, and we can ask questions and start thinking about how we might translate their designs into code. The meeting lasts for an hour, and once it's finished, we make a card in JIRA summarizing the discussed project. It's then added to our backlog of tasks.

**3pm :** Back at my desk, I take the next card from the sprint planning column in JIRA and start the time tracker. The time tracker helps us plan our time more efficiently - we get a good overview of how much time we're spending on what, and we can make realistic estimates for future projects. Once I've finished my task, I'll move it to the QA column in JIRA.

**5pm :** I spend the last hour of the day tying up any loose ends and getting ready for tomorrow. I'll check the projects that I submitted before lunch to see if they've been reviewed yet. If they have, I'll go through the feedback and apply all the changes requested, and then re-submit for further review. I'll then attend to any bug fixes or requests from the other developers, and review any code that has been submitted. If I have time, I would like to end the day by watching a video tutorial. At the moment, I'm learning about front-end testing with Jest, a testing framework for JavaScript.

**6pm :** Around six, I close my laptop and head home. I generally don't work overtime unless there is something really urgent to deal with. As long as I've wrapped everything up and know what I'm doing the next day, I'm ready to leave on time.

**6.30pm** onwards, I like to unwind by watching TV or playing piano. On some evenings, I'll work on freelance projects after I've had dinner and spent some time with my family. Generally, I try to take a break from programming - however, ideas often come to me as I am in bed falling asleep, so I grab my phone, type out a quick email to myself and send it to my work address. I haven't configured my work email or calendar on my phone, as I prefer to maintain a healthy balance between my work life and personal life. I try to leave my work in the office as much as I can.

### What are the different teams involved for the projects?

We have multiple guys working on the projects. Let me tell you how the work is divided among them.

- **Product Manager** - Gathers the requirement from the stakeholder/client and breaks it down into tasks. Product manager also assigns the tasks to the team members.
- **Designer** - Designs the look and feel of the product via using the designing tools based on the assigned task. For example, design the FAQ section of the website.
- **Frontend Developer** - Creates/Develops the user interface, implements interaction and adds business logic to talk to the backend APIs to showcase it to the user. For example, retrieves the FAQ details from backend, provides the look and feel as designed by the designer and shows it to the user.
- **Backend Developer** - Accepts the requests from the frontend and delivers the appropriate response. Backend developers are responsible for saving, updating and deleting the data from the server. For example, user wants requests for a list of FAQs and the backend developers creates an API that sends the list.

### How would you suggest newcomers to build newer capabilities and learn new technologies?

Below I have listed a few pointers as recommendations. You are not restricted to stick to these points only.

- Sign up on platforms such as Twitter, LinkedIn, YouTube, etc and follow the masters of the domain. An example would be to follow the creator of the library that you are using.
- Sometimes you have to shell out money to stay ahead of others. Invest in buying good courses or books that make sure you catch up with the trend.
- Read blogs written by good developers on Medium, CSS Tricks, Hackernoon, etc
- Sign up for newsletters e.g front end daily
- Attend conferences
- Attend meetups organized in your town or city
- Talk to your colleagues about inquire about their interests pertaining to the domain

### What advice would you want to give for a person who wants to start fresh in this field?

Well to summarize, it can be quite difficult and overwhelming starting out in the field of front-end development. My thoughts have been well charted out in the link I recently went through.
