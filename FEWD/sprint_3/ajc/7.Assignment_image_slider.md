## Assignment: Auto Image Slider

### Problem Statement
##### Task 1
Make a request using `fetch() API` to [https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/photos](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/photos) to retrieve an array of photo detail objects. Click on the link to see the sample response. It should be an array of photo detail objects.

##### Task 2
Reduce the **size of the response array** to the top five photo details.

##### Task 3
Create an image slider with thumbnails using the **reduced response array**. The slider should look similar to the image provided in the link: [https://www.jqueryscript.net/images/Basic-Thumbnail-Image-Slider-Plugin-with-jQuery-Thumb-slider.jpg](https://www.jqueryscript.net/images/Basic-Thumbnail-Image-Slider-Plugin-with-jQuery-Thumb-slider.jpg)

To render thumbnails, use `thumbnailUrl` from the response.

##### Task 5
Add arrow keys next to the Slider images to slide the images. Slider should slide on clicking thumbnail images as well.

### Input
Photo details from [https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/photos](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/photos) API.

### Output
Image Slider with thumbnails

### Constraints
 - Use the `fetch()` API for API call.
 - Use jQuery for DOM manipulation.
 - Use lodash once for any array/object manipulation.
 - Try using the ES6 concepts you learnt directly without using any transpiler. It'll give an understanding of the properties and methods supported by the latest browsers. Ignore properties and switch back to vanilla JS if the property or method doesn't work.
