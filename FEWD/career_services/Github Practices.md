## Why GitHub

As of 2018, GitHub reported having more than 28 million users, significantly more than its competitors. Most of the company prefers using this platform over any other for hosting code repositories.

The other differences involve cost. GitHub offers private repositories only at an additional cost, while a few of the other services offer private repositories for free. However, these typically come with limited storage and bandwidth.

Using GitHub makes it easier to collaborate with colleagues and peers and look back at previous versions of your work. If you aren&#39;t already using GitHub for your coding projects, here are a few reasons to consider doing so.
