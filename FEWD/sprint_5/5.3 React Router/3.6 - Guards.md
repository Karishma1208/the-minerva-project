# Guards

## Overview

In this session, we will learn how to protect routes from unauthenticated entries.

## Learning Outcome

•	How to protect your application’s routes from unauthenticated users?


## Introduction

As we grow with our application, we realize that at times, we might need an authentication system. A system, where the user can login to our application and then move around the application. However, one of the key points in this is that the user should not be able to access some of the pages if he is not authenticated. For instance, the unauthenticated users of an e-commerce application should not be able to place an order if they have not logged in.
Basically, we need to implement a system where the routes are protected or guarded.

## What you must do?

•	Read [this piece](https://tylermcginnis.com/react-router-protected-routes-authentication/) on how to guard the routes. As usual, try to practice the code on your own to understand it better.
