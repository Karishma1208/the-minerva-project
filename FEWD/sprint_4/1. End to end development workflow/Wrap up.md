# Wrap up

*What did you learn?*

After going through the concept, you should now have a clear idea about how a web development project flows from ideation, initialization to final delivery and deployment. 

You should also have the knowledge about the various stakeholders involved in this process.

## Assignment

*Key take-aways*

-	Every web development team has at least a Product Manager, Requirements Analyst, UX/UI Designer, Front-end developers, Back-end developers, QA Engineers.

-	Depending on various factors and the product itself, a web dev team might also include a Development Operations (DevOps) Engineer and/or Marketing team.

-	A Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is the process of a software from ideation to deployment and maintenance.

-	There are many different types of SDLC methods depending upon the requirements, team structure and client.

-	A requirements analyst’s primary job is to gather requirements and connect to the client to understand their need for the product.

-	A UX/UI designer’s primary job is to create mockups and wireframes depicting the final product and consult with the client to get their approval on them.

-	A Product Manager’s primary job is to oversee the development of the entire team and be the connecting balance between client’s business needs and team’s technical know-how. He is also responsible to connect with the finance team to get the necessary software contract signed with the client.

-	Developers can be primarily classified as front-end who create the user interface of the application; back-end who create the logical design of the application. 

-	There is also a category called full-stack developers who do everything from front-end and back-end to deployment.

-	QA Engineers are the ones who thoroughly test the application before it moves on for deployment.

-	After a web application has been deployed, it’s also crucial to maintain the application till it’s no longer in use. Maintenance can be new requests, resolving bugs, adapting new technologies or preventing future issues.
