# Operations on a Linked List

## Overview
We know how to create a list. However most questions are centred around operations on a list. Some of the most common ones are inserting new elements, deleting exiting ones and traversing the list. Let us see them in detail.
## Learning Outcomes
- Deep understanding of the three basic operations in a linked list
- Develop an intuition to solve problems on linked list.
- Implement a few basic programs to solve problems on a list.

## Introduction
Some of the basic problems in a linked list are traversal, insertion and deletion. Traversal is obviously the easiest of the lot. Loop through the nodes going one after the other by using the address of the next node stored in the current till you encounter a null value. It must start with the head. Trick Question: *How will you traverse the list in reverse order* ?

Insertion is tricky as it inolves changing the address of the previous node. It must be visualized to make sure no erroneous links are created. Inserting at thr front must be handled differently.

Deletion poses the same problem. Links must be altered to make sure the list order remains correct. Deletion of the last node must be handled correctly.

There are many problems ranging from as easy as counting the number of nodes (Traversal with an extra counter variable) to reversing the links of the list. Lets dive into the implementation and solve these operations.

## What you must do
- Learn how to [traverse a list](https://www.javatpoint.com/traversing-in-singly-linked-list). It will also be covered in further links.
- Learn how to [insert elements in a list](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbvsNF22Ud0&list=PL2_aWCzGMAwI3W_JlcBbtYTwiQSsOTa6P&index=7)
- [Delete elements in a list](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0n86K43GO4&list=PL2_aWCzGMAwI3W_JlcBbtYTwiQSsOTa6P&index=8)
- Check out the [Implementation details in Javascript](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~adamchik/15-121/lectures/Linked%20Lists/linked%20lists.html)
- Some problems you should attempt. Note the logic behind the solution and compare it with yours. The key is to develop algorithmic thinking
  - Find the [length of a list using a recursive algorithm](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/find-length-of-a-linked-list-iterative-and-recursive/)
  - [Print the middle of the list](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/write-a-c-function-to-print-the-middle-of-the-linked-list/)
  - [Move last element to the first](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/move-last-element-to-front-of-a-given-linked-list/). Think if you can use the basic functions to do this.

## Assessment Quiz
1. Can a pointer variable store a regular integer ?
    - Yes
    - No*

2. In the worst case, the number of comparisons needed to search a singly linked list of length n for a given element is
   - logn
   - nlogn
   - n*
   - n*n

3. Arrange the following in order<br>
   a. Create a node<br>
   b. Iterate a list from head to node before point of Insertion<br>
   c. Store the value of next node in a separate variable<br>
   d. Point from current to new nodes<br>
   e. Point new node to next<br>

   - b,c,a,d,e*
   - a,b,d,c,e
   - d,b,a,c,e
   - a,c,b,d,e

4. What does the following function do for a given Linked List with first node as head?<br>
```C++
void fun1(struct node* head)
{
    if(head == NULL)
    return;
    fun1(head->next);
    printf("%d  ", head->data);
}
```
    - Prints all nodes of linked lists
    - Prints all nodes of linked list in reverse order*
    - Prints alternate nodes of Linked List
    - Prints alternate nodes in reverse order

5. What does the following function do for a given Linked List with first node as head?<br>
```C++
void function(Node node)
{
	node.setNext(head);
	head = node;
	size++;
}
```
    - Insert at front*
    - Insert at end
    - Do nothing
