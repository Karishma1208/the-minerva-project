# Walkthrough Solutions using Greedy Approach

## Overview
In this section, we will learn and explore the problems being solved using Greedy Approach. 
Studying of greedy approach/heuristic is important as a lot of programming tests and interviews will test you on your ability to write solutions to the programming problems using most efficient code which takes the minimum time and resources to converge to the result.

## Learning Outcome
- What is Greedy Approach?
- How can it be applied for solving different problems?

## Introduction
Greedy approach as the name suggests tries to find most profitable immediate path to the solution and hopes to end with the most optimal global solutions

Greedy approach are useful for optimization problems. They make the optimal choice at a localized and immediate level, with the aim being that you’ll find the optimal solution you want. It’s important to note that they don’t always find you the best solution for the  problem you’re trying to solve – so apply them wisely.
