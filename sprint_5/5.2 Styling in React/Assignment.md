# **Assignment**

In this assignment, you will use the principles of CSS Modules and everything you have learnt in this concept to style the ‘Build MY Burger’ application.

You need to do the following:

1.	Use CSS modules to create styles for the ‘Build My Burger’ project.

2.	Eject the CRA and then create CSS module configurations. Create a hashed local indent for every file.

3.	Use your imagination to style the navbar. It should have the logo on the left side of the navbar. The logo could be nothing, but a text called ‘Build My Burger’. Leave the right-hand side of the navbar to add navigation links.

4.	Next, style each and every ingredient of the burger as per your discretion.

5.	Style the button and add hover to the button.
