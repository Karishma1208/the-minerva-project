### Introduction

Web development is the creation of dynamic web applications including social networking sites like Instagram or e-commerce sites like Amazon.

Web Development could refer to a single web page built with HTML and CSS that might contain a couple hundred lines of code or it could refer to a website like Instagram that contains millions of lines of code. Put very vaguely it is about **"creating applications which run in a web browser"**. 

There are two broad divisions of web development – front-end development (also called client-side development) and back-end development (also called server-side development). Both these developments are collectively also known as full-stack development. In this course, we focus on teaching you front-end development

Front-end development refers to constructing what a user sees when they load a web application – the content, design and how you interact with it.  Front-end developers use relevant frameworks to ensure that content is presented effectively and that users have an excellent experience.


It goes without saying that more and more applications have moved to the web and continue to do so and therefore is an exciting field to explore and build a carreer at.
