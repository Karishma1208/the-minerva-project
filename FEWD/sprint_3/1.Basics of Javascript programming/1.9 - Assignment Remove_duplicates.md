## BJSP Assignment: Remove Duplicates

### Problem Statement
Given an array of numbers with duplicate values, write a function to return an array of approximately equally divided sorted array of unique numbers. For example, if the user provides an array of numbers say
> [1, 10, 20, 2, 5, 2, 2, 2, 5, 3, 4, 8]

Here, numbers = 1.....20 and array of numbers = [1, 10, 20, 2, 5, 2, 2, 2, 5, 3, 4, 8]

Your function should return an array of **equally** divided two array of **sorted** numbers in **ascending** order after **removing the duplicates**. There is a built in method named [sort](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_array_sort.asp) to help you with sorting. So, the result for the above would look like:
> [[1,  2, 3, 4], [5, 8, 10, 20]]

Now, if the total count of numbers is uneven and the array cannot be divided into exactly 2 arrays of same length, then add the remaining number in the first array. So say, we have an array:
> [1, 3, 2, 2]

Then, the final result would be:
> [[1, 2], [3]]

If the total count of numbers is one and the array cannot be divided into exactly 2 arrays of same length, then return an array of only one array. So say, we have an array:
> [3]

Then, the final result would be:
> [[3]]

### Sample Input
[1, 9, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 5, 6, 6, 9, 10, 10]

### Sample Output
[[1, 2, 3, 4, 5], [6, 7, 8, 9, 10]]

### Constraints
- 1 < number < 10^3
- 2 < Array of numbers < 10^3


**Note:** For evaluation, add the code file in the same repo as your Sprint 3 github project folder.
