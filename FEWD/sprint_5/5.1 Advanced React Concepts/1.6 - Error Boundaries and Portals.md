## Overview

In this session, we will find out how to handle errors in React using Error Boundaries. We will also learn about Portals – a first-class way to render children into a DOM node that exists outside its parent.


## Learning Outcome

•	How to handle errors in React?

•	What are Error Boundaries and how to use them?

•	Where can we not use Error Boundaries?

•	What are Portals?

•	How to use portals?

•	When to use portals?

## Error Boundaries

Since React is also JavaScript, there will always be instances where an unforeseen error might tend to break the entire app. It then paints an ugly picture of the brand if it fails in production environment. Therefore, it is very important to catch these errors. Error Boundaries help us to achieve exactly that.

## What you must do?

•	Read [this post](https://reactjs.org/docs/error-boundaries.html) about Error Boundaries.


## Portals

At many instances during your React coding, you might need to create elements which are outside the DOM of the parent component. For such scenarios, React introduced Portals.
