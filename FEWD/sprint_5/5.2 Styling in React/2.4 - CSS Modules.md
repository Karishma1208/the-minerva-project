## CSS Modules

We already know that CSS is used for styling web pages and it does a fantastic job, that is. However, if you are building an enterprise-level web application (e.g. Amazon, Flipkart, etc.), the sheer amount of the number of styles and their interoperability is one massive confusing affair.
