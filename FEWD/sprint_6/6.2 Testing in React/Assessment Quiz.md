# **Concept Quiz**

1. In Test Driven Development, the process begins with writing a scenario. - True or False?

        a. True. 
        b. False. 

<br />

2. In Enzyme, ______ is used for rendering the full DOM.

        a. mount. 
        b. render.
        c. shallow.

<br />

3. If the user simply wants to check whether the component has matched the expected rendering, we use ``` expect(component)._________ () ```.

        a. toHaveBeenCalled();
        b. toMatchSnapshot(); 
        c. toEqual(expectedAction);
        d. .contains.

<br />

4. Enzyme's mount() is _____ testing.

        a. Unit.
        b. Regression.
        c. Snapshot.
        d. Integration. 

<br />

5. The entire point of writing unit tests with Jest is to ensure that the test initially fails. - True or False?

        a. True. 
        b, False.

<br />

6. Jest will alphabetically sort the props received in the ```expect``` function before verifying it against the snapshot. - True or False?

        a. True. 
        b. False. 

<br />

7.  ```
    expect(mockCallback.mock.calls[1][0]).toBe(1);
    ```

    What does this signify?


        a. The mock function is called twice.
        b. The first argument of the first call to the function was 0.
        c. The first argument of the second call to the function was 1.

8. Enzyme help us get access to its own properties and state as well as its children props in order to run our assertions. - True or False?

        a. True. 
        b. False.

<br />

9. You don't need to have any programming knowledge to understand the tests in _____.
