## Overview
We have studied Binary trees and different operations related to it
Now we will progress to Binary Search Trees which are an upgrade over the Binary trees

It is the first of many data structures which were developed by extending the concept of Binary trees.

## Learning Outcome
- What is a Binary Search Tree (BST)?
- How are Binary Search trees better than Binary trees

## Introduction

A binary search tree is a special variant and most commonly used form of binary tree. 

It is made of nodes where each node has at most 2 references, a "left" reference and a "right" reference and a data element. The tree additionally satisfies the binary search tree property, which states that the key in each node must be greater than all keys stored in the left sub-tree, and smaller than all keys in right sub-tree.


## What you must do?
