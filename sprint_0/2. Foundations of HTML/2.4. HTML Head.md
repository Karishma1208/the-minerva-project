- What is HTML head?

- What are the different webpage metadata?

### Introduction

Let's relook at the web page template once more.

***
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        <!-- Metadata goes here -->
    </head>
    <body>
        <!-- Content goes here -->
    </body>
</html>    
```
***

So far we have only talked about elements inside HTML body. We also have HTML head. Unlike the contents of the `<body>` element, the head's content is not displayed on the page. The head contains 'metadata' about the document. 

--- 
*Metdata*

Metadata means "data about data".

When it comes to web pages, Metadata refer to the description of a web page that are encoded into the page but not actually displayed on the screen when the page is loaded. 


The actual use of this invisible data is done by the search engines. It is this data that provides important information to search engines about the content and purpose of the web page.

---
Following are the two most commonly used HTML head tags:

**Title**    
The `<title>` element is metadata that represents the title of the overall HTML document (not the document's content.) It is the title that appears in the browser tab the page is loaded in. 

**Meta**

Metadata is data that describes data, and HTML has an "official" way of adding metadata to a document â€” the `<meta>` element. 

There are a lot of different types of `<meta>` elements that can be included in your page's `<head>` including language, author, etc.
