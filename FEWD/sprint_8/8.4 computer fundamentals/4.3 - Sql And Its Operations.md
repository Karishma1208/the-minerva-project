## Overview
In the previous section, we studied database management, now we will learn SQL which a language used to perform database operations. 
We will continue to revise and broaden our computing knowledge by studying SQL that is the gold standard in database management.

## Learning Outcome

- What are different data types in SQL?
- Learn most commonly used SQL commands

## Introduction

SQL is short for Structured Query Language and is a widely used database language, providing means of data manipulation (store, retrieve, update, delete) and database creation.

Almost all modern Relational Database Management Systems like MS SQL Server, Microsoft Access, MSDE, Oracle, DB2, Sybase, MySQL, Postgres and Informix use SQL as standard database language. Now a word of warning here, although all those RDBMS use SQL, they use different SQL dialects.
