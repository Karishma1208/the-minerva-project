### Responsive Design and Mobile First Approach

A **responsive website design** is the one that has been designed to respond, or adapt, based on the technology and type of computing device used by the visitor to display the site. It is basically one website design that will looks good at any size — from a large desktop LCD monitor to the smaller screens we use on smartphones and tablets. Responsive design ensures visitors to the site have a similar experience that is independent of the of the size of the device device used to view the site. It is a website development philosophy of rendering web pages in an efficient, optimized and easy-to-read format across a variety of devices and web browsers on different platforms.

A **“mobile-first” approach** involves designing a desktop site starting with the mobile version, which is then adapted to larger screens (contrary to the traditional approach of starting with a desktop site and then adapting it to smaller screens). Generally speaking, a mobile-first approach means building your website with your mobile users in mind, with the main goal of improving the mobile **users’ experience** on your site.
