### Introduction

We learned one of HTML's main jobs is to give text structure and meaning (also known as semantics) so that a browser can display it correctly. 

To help with the text data, HTML has various tags. The most used ones include:

- `<p>` tag: 

The paragraph `<p>` tag marks the text inside it as a separate paragraph. 

- `<h>` tag: 

In HTML, there are six heading elements â€” `<h1>` to `<h6>` to accomodate the headings. The higher the number, the less prominent the heading.
 
- `<li>` tag:

Lists are a great way of conveying information. Lists, therefore are available on the Web as well.

There are two types of list:

    - Unordered(`<ul>`)

Unordered lists help mark up lists of items for which the order of the items `doesn't` matter(For eg. List of phone companies) 

    - Ordered(`<ol>`)

Ordered lists help mark up lists of items for which the order of the items `does` matter(For eg. Instructions for riding bike)

Other than these tags, HTML also has other elements like "empty elements" and "comments" for better formatting and maintenance.
