## Introduction

While almost majority of the times, you can rely on styles set statically by a stylesheet or inline, there are times when you need to set style based on a condition.
For instance, let’s just say I have a form with a submit button. In an ideal scenario, I would prefer having the button disabled if the user has not filled anything in the text boxes in the form. On the same lines, if the user has finished typing in all the boxes, I would prefer switching on the button. Such dynamism can be achieved by setting styles dynamically.
