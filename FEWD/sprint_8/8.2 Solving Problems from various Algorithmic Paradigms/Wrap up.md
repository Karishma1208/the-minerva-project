# Wrap Up

## What did you learn?

We studied different algorithmic paradigms - Greedy approach, Divide & Conquer and Dynamic Programming by looking at different walkthrough solutions. Then we proceeded to applying these concepts for some problems which can have a naive solution, but using these algorithms will give us efficient solutions at a scale.

## Key take-aways
- We understood how greedy approach, divide & conquer and dynamic programming work
- Time and memory complexity of these techniques
- We understood how these algorithms don't matter at small scale, but for larger data or lot of computations they tend to give better results.
- Differences between the performance and implementation in greedy approach, divide & conquer and dynamic programming
