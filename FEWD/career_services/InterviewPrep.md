# Interview Prep


## Overview

Understand important FE concepts and prepare yourself for FE interviews

## Learning Outcomes
- Refresh your HTML/CSS knowledge
- Know and revise important JS concepts
- Know and revise important DS & A concepts
- Practice algorithmic thinking by programming
- Learn how to approach problems and develop critical thinking


## Introduction

So you have finished upskilling yourself in HTML/CSS and JavaScript.
You have good portfolio projects in your github. The next logical assumption would be is that you are ready for interviews. That unfortunately is not a correct assumption.


Front-end job interviews have great emphasis on algorithms/critical thinking and questions on expertise about the domain(HTML, CSS, JavaScript). That means they not only test you on what you know but also on whether you know where and how to implement your concepts in an efficient and scalable manner. This means that before going for FE interviews, let's brush up our knowledge.

FE Hiring typically involve two rounds:

- Coding Challenge Round

- Interview Round

Let's see how we can prepare for them by dealing with them one by one.

## *Coding Challenge Round*

This round involves solving coding challenges that test your programming language as well as algorithmic thinking.

## What you must do?

- Solve [coding challenges(min. 10)](https://edabit.com/challenges/javascript) to improve your JS coding. Focus particularly on the coding questions of easy and medium difficulty.

- Solve [OOPs questions](https://www.techgig.com/practice/java/object-oriented-programming) to understand the importance of it. 
(Note: The questions are expected to be solved in Java but feel free to use JavaScript as well)

- Practice top [coding interview questions of HTML/CSS](https://www.testdome.com/d/html-css-interview-questions/3) and [coding interview questions of JS](https://www.testdome.com/d/javascript-interview-questions/2) 


- Practice basic [Data Structures and Algorithm questions](https://exercism.io/my/tracks/javascript). Focus on the "algorithms" and "data structures" topic(You can filter it on the site). Increase your expertise by solving more complicated [DS & A problems](https://www.spoj.com/problems/tag/datastructures)

## *Interview Round*

This round involves either telephonic/in person interview where the interviwer will test your critical thinking and problem solving questions

## What you must do?


- Go through a compiled list of [front end interview questions](https://edabit.com/challenges/javascript). Try to first answer the questions without looking at the solutions, then refer to the solutions to understand the optimum way to answer them.



- Understand [how to approach DS questions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9iELB1VzZWA) for web developer interviews. Briefly go through [DS tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2CEgPsws3U) to imbibe important DS concepts
