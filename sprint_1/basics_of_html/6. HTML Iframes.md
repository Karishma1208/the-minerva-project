## Overview

This section will help you understand the concept of loading a website or widget that might or might have a different URL into your webpage with iframes.

## Learning Outcome

- What is a iframe?
- What's a browsing context?
- How to load another site or widget in our webpage?
- What are the restrictions of using a iframe?

### HTML Forms

The **HTML Inline Frame element (`<iframe>`)** represents a nested browsing context, embedding another HTML page into the current one.

**What's a browsing context?**
A **browsing context** is the environment in which a browser displays a `Document` (normally a tab nowadays, but possibly also a window or a frame within a page).

Each browsing context has a specific origin (combination of scheme, host, domain and port where the site is hosted), the origin of the active document, and a history that lists all the displayed documents in order.

Communication between browsing contexts is severely restricted.

### Summary

In this unit, we learnt how to render a site within our site. Iframes are commonly used to load a media from another site or for `Single sign on`. Single sign on helps an organization provide their login and authentication system to other systems. (e.g Google login or facebook login from your site). It cannot be just achieved using HTML.
