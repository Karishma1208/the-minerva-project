# Wrap up

## What did you learn?

In this concept, we learned about the basics of deployment and how to deploy a React app created using create-react-app to a hosting platform like Firebase. We also learned the difference between Webpack and create-react-application.


## Key take-aways

- Deployment is a very crucial stage in the lifecycle of a web development project.

- We have to imagine the web development project as not one, but two units front-end and back-end communicating with each other.
- A website needs to be thoroughly tested before being deployed.
- Bundling is a process of creating smaller files of front-end. Smaller front-end files mean lesser time for downloading and thereby, quicker loading of pages.
- Create-react-app automatically does the process of bundling for us, thereby relieving most of the pressure.
- However, CRA also imposes a lot of restrictions on the webpack configuration that it sets.
- By ejecting, we can get control over the webpack configuration.
- Firebase is an excellent hosting platform for deploying React applications.


*How will it help the project?*

Just like the first concept, this concept also has a very large impact in your web development career.

No matter where you work or what type of projects you are doing, the topics covered in the concept will help you immensely.

As practice, we recommend you to deploy all the previous Sprint Projects and Assignment using Firebase. This will not only help you get the hang of the deployment process but also enable you to showcase all your projects to your peers/potential recruiters/family members.

Since this is the last concept of this Sprint, the only thing remaining is to Build the Sprint Project(Financial Portfolio Tracker) and deploy it.

ALL THE BEST.
