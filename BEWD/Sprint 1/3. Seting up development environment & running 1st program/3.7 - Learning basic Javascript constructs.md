### Overview

This introduces you to the basic constructs in Javascript. This is where you begin to learn of how you can express your logic using a programming language and get small chunks of it running to build something useful.

### Learning Outcomes
- What are variables, where they are used and how to use them?

- What are data types & how type conversions work?

- How is flow controlled in Javascript?

- How to Loop through data?

- How to print result of your program?

- What are arrays & objects?

- What are functions? How can we benefit by using these?

- What is scoping? How are variables and functions scoped?
