##### Task 1

Create the HTML Structure of the page looking at the template.

We have provided the necessary images you would need for the site.

On clicking on the social media icons present at the bottom, it should open in the new tab.

##### Task 2

Apply the CSS to your HTML structure. Your site should look similar to the site you see in the template.

**BONUS TIP** - To pick up colors from the zomato template image,

- Load the image (Template of the site) in chrome or firefox. (Right click -> open in your browser of choice among the 2)
- Install [Colorzilla](https://www.colorzilla.com/chrome/help.html) for your browser.
- Now, you can pick colors from the image

##### Task 3

Use media queries for making the header and banner (section after header) of the site responsive.

##### Task 3

Use SASS features that you've learnt to build the site. We atleast expect you to use nesting and mixins. Create a simple mixin for reusing media queries and breakpoints. Just because, you read simple doesn't mean you keep it dead simple. Try to be creative. We would love to see different solutions.

##### Task 3

Use the concepts you have learnt in the unit that covered Bootstrap to make the site responsive. Use as many features as you can. Create atleast one section with Bootstrap Grid layout.

#### Input
