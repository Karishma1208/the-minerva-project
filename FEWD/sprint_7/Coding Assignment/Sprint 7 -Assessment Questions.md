# Sprint 7 Coding Project

## Overview
Breaking away from tradition, the sprint 7 project consists of several competetive coding challenges that require a certain level of algorithmic thinking. You must submit the screenshot of the solution in the Google Form below.

## What you must do?

Solve the coding challenges given below as part of your sprint 7 project.
After solving them, you need to submit the screenshots of the solution

Understand [how to submit the solution](https://github.com/greyatom-school/the-minerva-project/blob/master/FEWD/sprint_7/Coding%20Assignment/Submit_Instructions.md)


## Searching and Sorting

1. Anushri is the physical education teacher for class 5. She has a list of the heights of all his 15 students in a list. Write an efficient algorithm to help her find the shortest and second shortest student in the class.
<pre><code>
Input:  arr[] = {12, 13, 1, 10, 34, 1}
Output: 1, 10
</pre></code>
2. Yaniv is an israeli card game where the motive is to get as close to zero as possible. If you have a list of integers (both positive and negative) write an algorithm which returns two numbers that gives you the best chance of winning at Yaniv
<pre><code>
Input:  arr[] = {1, 60, -10, 70, -80, 85}
Output: -80, 85
</pre></code>
3. Boxes are loaded in a row arranged by increasing weight. However, due to a mistake, first few are placed at the end. Find the position at which the mistake needs to be correcred. For example, in the list [4,5,6,7,1,2,3] the mistake is at position 4. Do it faster than linear time - O(n) ?
<pre><code>
Input: {5, 6, 1, 2, 3, 4}
Output: 2
</pre></code>
4. In an independence day parade, students are wearing Saffron, Green and White Shirts but are not standing in order. Write an algorithm that sorts them in the correct tricolor sequence. For instance, [W,S,G,G,S,W] should become [S,S,W,W,G,G].
<pre><code>
Input: {0, 1, 2, 0, 1, 2}
Output: {0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 2}
</pre></code>

## Linked List

5. Ten integers are lined up in a queue. Let each integer be the element of a node in a linked list connected to each other via links. Write a function to remove from the queue all elements that are multiples of four.
<pre><code>
Input: 2->3->8->10->12
Output: 2->3->10
</pre></code>
6. In a queue at a concert, lets say that each person is like a node in a linked list and connected by links. Write an algorithm to find the n-th person from the back.
<pre><code>
Input: 20->4->15->35->40 , 2
Output: 35
Explanation: 35 is the 2nd element from back
</pre></code>
7. In the same queue, print the names of the people in reverse order. So, print the name of the last person first and so on. Let one person be a node in a linked list. The data should be the name while the link should be to the next person in the queue.
<pre><code>
Input: 20->4->15->35->40
Output: 40->35->15->4->20
</pre></code>
8. In a game of chinese whisper, a message is passed from one person to another in a row till the last. However the same person should not receive the message twice. Assume that the players are nodes in a linked list and check whether the condition is violated.<br>
Input: ![](img/Linked-List-Loop.gif)<br>
Output: Loop Exists
