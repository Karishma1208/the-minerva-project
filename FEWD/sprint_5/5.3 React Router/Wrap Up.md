# Wrap Up

## What did you learn?

In this concept, we learnt about routing in React applications. We got introduced to a package library called react-router which aids in helping routing React apps. We learnt about the different components of the react-router. We also learnt about history, match and location properties of Router components. Finally, we learnt about redirections in React.

## Key takeaways

•	The package **react-router** aids in routing React applications.

•	We need to encapsulate the routing component with **BrowserRouter**. Using **Links** and **Router**, we can create route paths inside the React application.

•	**NavLink** component helps us style active links.

•	Router component also provides three brilliant properties called **history**, **location** and **match**. History helps us do time travel in React components, location helps us find all the relevant information about the current page. Finally, match helps us find parameters related to the URLs.

•	Like Context APIs earlier, the **withRouter** package helps pass router properties to deeply nested components.

•	The ```<Redirect />``` component helps redirect React application to other pages in case of failures.

•	Redirect is also used to authenticate paths.
