# Array Implementation of Stacks and Queues

## Overview
Having discusses the basics of Stacks and Queues, we will talk about the array implementation strategy. This will develop intuition towards writing functions on regular arrays and converting them to different data structures.
## Learning Outcomes

It is almost simple to create both a Stack and Queue using an array. Instead of inserting an element t the back as it comes, it goes in the front for a Stack while the opposite for a Queue. Deletions only happen at one place for both.
