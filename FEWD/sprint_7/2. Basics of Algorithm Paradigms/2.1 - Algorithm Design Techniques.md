# Algorithm Design Techniques

## Overview

So now we have a general idea about what algorithms are and how they are evaluated. It is now time to look at the I different ways of classifying the algorithms and in topics we will focus on a few of them. Every problem we solve may fall into one or more of these categories.

Interviewrs generally like to discuss the approach. In an interview, they indulge the applicant into conversation about their thinking when it comes to approaching prolems. They try to gauge how you tackle obstacles and look for solutions. Learning about algorithmic techniques will assure the interviewer that you have the knowledge to approach problems. 
## Learning Outcomes

- What are the different ways of classifying algorithms
- Gain brief idea about how they are different and can avail different results

## Introduction

There are primarily two ways to classify algorithms
- By Implementation method
  - Based on the strategy used to write code
- By Design method
  - Based on the strategy used to solve the problem

It must be noted that there can be more than one way to solve a problem. It may fall in different classess. The efficiency may not be the same.
