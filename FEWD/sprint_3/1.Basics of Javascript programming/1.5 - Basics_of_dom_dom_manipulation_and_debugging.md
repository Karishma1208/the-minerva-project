## Overview

This concept will help you understand the basics of DOM and how to manipulate DOM for dynamic updates. We'll also learn how to debug JS.

At the end of this topic, you'd have a better understanding of DOM and you'd be able to update it dynamically.

Once you covered the topic, create a paragraph tag and add an id attribute to the tag. ID name can be anything. Use javascript to select the paragraph tag with the id name you have provided and add a background color using JavaScript.

## Learning Outcome

- What is DOM?
- Why do we need to manipulate DOM?
- How to debug JS?

### Basics of DOM and DOM manipulation

**DOM** is a way to represent the webpage in the structured hierarchical way so that it will become easier for programmers and users to glide through the document. With DOM, we can easily access and manipulate tags, IDs, classes, Attributes or Elements using commands or methods provided by Document object.

#### What you must do?

- Go through this 4 part video series to understand DOM in depth. DOM manipulation is an important aspect that JS developers need to understand for playing with the DOM efficiently. - [JavaScript DOM Crash Course - Part 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ik6X4DJKCc) - [JavaScript DOM Crash Course - Part 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPd2aJXCZ2g) - [JavaScript DOM Crash Course - Part 3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wK2cBMcDTss) - [JavaScript DOM Crash Course - Part 4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i37KVt_IcXw)

### Debugging

Programming code might contain syntax errors, or logical errors. Many of these errors are difficult to diagnose. Often, when programming code contains errors, nothing will happen. There are no error messages, and you will get no indications where to search for errors.

Searching for (and fixing) errors in programming code is called code debugging.

#### What you must do?

- Please watch the video to understand Debugging. This is a crucial concept too as you'll be spending a lot of time debugging while you code - [Debugging techniques with Javascript](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EXNtmgf87s)
