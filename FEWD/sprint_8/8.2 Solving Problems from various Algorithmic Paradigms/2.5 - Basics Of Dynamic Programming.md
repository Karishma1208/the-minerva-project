# Basics of Dynamic Programming

## Overview
In this section, we will study dynamic programming which makes solving a lot of problems much faster and efficient. In some situation where you have limited computation resources like in a lot of programming tests during interviews, dynamic programming often turns out to be "Ace" programming approach to solve the given problem.


## Learning Outcome
 - What is dynamic programming?
 - How to use to it?
 - What are its advantages and disadvantages?
## Introduction

**Dynamic programming**  is an optimization method which was developed by  [Richard Bellman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_E._Bellman).
It is used to solve the multistage optimization problem in which dynamic means reference to time and programming means planning or tabulation.
