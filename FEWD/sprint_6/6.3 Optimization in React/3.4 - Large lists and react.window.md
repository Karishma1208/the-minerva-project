# **Large List and React.Window**

## Overview

In this session, we will learn about how to render large lists (lists beyond 100 rows) using react.window.

This will help you in future projects where you might have to deal with creating more than 100 elements.

## Learning Outcomes

At the end of this session, you will learn:

- How to render extremely large lists in React?
- How to use react-window?


## React-window

More often than not, you will come across rendering elements that more than 100 or 1000 in number. For instance, take the example of an e-commerce website. Every mobile page search might result in close to hundreds of similar elements. To optimize creating such lists, we have ```react-window```.

## What you must do?

- This [blog article](https://addyosmani.com/blog/react-window/) is the one-stop shop for understanding the rendering of large lists.

## Additional Resources

- You should also have a look at react-window's [official GitHub page](https://github.com/bvaughn/react-window).

## Coding Assignment

In our 'Build My Burger' project, use react-window to optimize the list of 'Orders' page.
