# Analysis of Algorithms

## Overview

Now that we know what algorithms are, it is time to understand how to evaluate them. Afterall you want the best possible solution to a problem. This topic elaborates on how algorithms are analysed and discusses the metrics for the same.

## Learning Objectives

- Why is it important to analyze Algorithms
- What are the ways to measure their efficiency
- What is asymptotic analysis/notation
- How is it used to check the efficiency of different algorithm imlpementations
- Be able to judge the complexity of basic alogorithms using the Big-O notation

## Introduction

Algorithm analysis helps us to determine which algorithm is
most efficient in terms of time and space consumed. Running Time Analysis
is the process of determining how processing time increases as the size of the problem (input size) increases. The measure of run time is taken as a function of the size of the input to make it independent of the processing power of the machine. To put it more simply, it measures the efficiency of the algorithm based on the merits of the algorithm only and not on the peroformance of the computer. <br>

The efficiency is measured as a rate of growth which is defined as the rate at which the running time increases as a function of input.

## What you must do

-   Understand what [Asyptotic Analysis](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/analysis-of-algorithms-set-1-asymptotic-analysis/) is
-   Get an idea about the [types of analysis](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/analysis-of-algorithms-set-2-asymptotic-analysis/)
-   Gain deep insight into the [types of Asmptotic Notations](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/analysis-of-algorithms-set-2-asymptotic-analysis/). Pay more attention to the **Big-O** notation.
- [Look at the how simple iterative programs are analyzed](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/analysis-of-algorithms-set-4-analysis-of-loops/)
- Check out some examples of [Big O in Javascript](http://www.bradoncode.com/blog/2012/04/big-o-algorithm-examples-in-javascript.html)

## Some solved Examples

- What is the runtime complexity of the following code:
```c++
count = 0;
for (i = 1; i*i < n; i = i + 1){
    count = count + 1
}
```
Answer: The loop will run till i<sup>2</sup> < n. Thus the answer is O(n<sup>1/2</sup>)
- What is the runtime complexity of the following code:
```c++
count = 0;
for (i = n/2; i < n; i = i + 1){
    for (j = 1; j + n/2 < n; j = j + 1){
        for (k = 1; k < n; k = k * 2){
            count = count + 1
        }
    }
}
```
Answer: The outer loop will n/2 times. The middle loop will also run n/2 times and the inner loop will run log(n) times. Thus the answer is O(n<sup>2</sup>logn)

Answer: The outer loop will n/2 times. The middle loop will also run n/2 times and the inner loop will run log(n) times. Thus the answer is O(n<sup>2</sup>logn)
- Rate 1. O(logn), 2. O(nlogn) and 3. O(n) in order of increasing complexity
  - 1 -> 2 -> 3
  - 3 -> 2 -> 1
  - 1 -> 3 -> 2*
