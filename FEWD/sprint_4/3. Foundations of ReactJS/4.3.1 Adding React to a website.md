# Adding React to a website

**Why this concept?**

Now that you know how to create a basic element with React, let’s now begin with creating web applications using ReactJS.

This concept covers all the pivotal topics of ReactJS. To better onboard the topics, we will also be building a simple 'Build My Burger App' throughout the concept

It's features will include:
1. Choosing the ingredients

2. Placing an order

With that in mind, let' start!

## Overview

In this topic, we will learn two different ways of adding React to a website.


## Learning Outcome

To understand the current topic and the topics ahead in this course, you need to have a crystal-clear understanding of what JSX is and how to write a basic code in React. If you are still unsure, go through the previous sessions before starting this session.

At the end of this session, you will learn:
-	The two different ways to use React to create a website.
-	How to add ReactJS to an existing website by adding script tags?


## Introduction 


There are two scenarios and subsequently, two methods in which we can use ReactJS to create web applications:

Scenario 1: 
You have already created a web page using native HTML, CSS and JavaScript and now wish to add a React component to your web application.

Scenario 2: 
You are starting coding from scratch and wish to implement React right from the beginning. 

For scenario 1, we will use the traditional method of injecting ReactJS into the code via script tags. While for the latter, we will use something called as toolchain to create the React application from scratch.

In this session, though, we will simply target the first scenario and inject ReactJS into our code.


## What you must do?

-	Go through ReactJS official documentation to understand [how to add ReactJS to an existing code](https://reactjs.org/docs/add-react-to-a-website.html)

(Note: In the above link, there are two methods used to code in React. The first section shows coding in React without using JSX. It is used to support features natively supported by browsers. The section ends with installing Babel to use JSX for coding. If you got scared looking at how complicated coding without JSX is, don’t worry, in the rest of the course, we will be using JSX only for coding in React. However, it’s very crucial for you to understand how to code without JSX, as well.)
