### HTML5


The World Wide Web's markup language has always been HTML. HTML was primarily designed as a language for semantically describing scientific documents, although its general design and adaptations over the years have enabled it to be used to describe a number of other types of documents.

The main area that has not been adequately addressed by HTML is a vague subject referred to as Web Applications. HTML5 attempts to rectify this, while at the same time updating the HTML specifications to address issues raised in the past few years.

HTML5 is the latest evolution of the standard that defines HTML. The term represents two different concepts. It is a new version of the language HTML, with new elements, attributes, and behaviors, **and** a larger set of technologies that allows the building of more diverse and powerful Web sites and applications. This set is sometimes called HTML5 & friends and often shortened to just HTML5.

The most interesting new HTML5 elements are:

New  **semantic elements**  like  `<header>`,  `<footer>`,  `<article>`, and  `<section>`.

New  **attributes of form elements**  like number, date, time, calendar, and range.

New  **graphic elements**:  `<svg>`  and  `<canvas>`.

New  **multimedia elements**:  `<audio>`  and  `<video>`.

#### What you must do?

- HTML5 is supported in all modern browsers. In addition, all browsers, old and new, automatically handle unrecognized elements as inline elements.Read about the [browser support available for HTML5](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_browsers.asp)
- Read about the [new HTML5 elements](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_new_elements.asp). Please read about each tag that has been linked on the site rather than just skimming through it.
- Semantics is the study of the meanings of words and phrases in a language. Semantic elements = elements with a meaning.Read about the [semantic meaning of the new HTML5 elements while comparing it with the older ones](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_semantic_elements.asp)
- This link is entirely about how to migrate from HTML4 to HTML5.
It also demonstrates how to convert an HTML4 page into an HTML5 page, without destroying anything of the original content or structure.Read about how you can [migrate an existing site written in HTML4 to HTML5](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_migration.asp)
- Web developers are often uncertain about the coding style and syntax to use in HTML. Between 2000 and 2010, many web developers converted from HTML to XHTML. With XHTML, developers were forced to write valid and "well-formed" code. HTML5 is a bit more sloppy when it comes to code validation.Read about the [coding conventions and best practices when you are writing HTML5](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_syntax.asp)
