# Basics of Stacks and Queues

## Overview
We have already covered the basics of Stacks and Queues in sprint 3. Let this topic be a refresher to a very crucial topic. Both these data structures have essential applications in creating algorithms, operating systems, compiler design etc.

## Learning Outcomes
- Refresh your knowledge about Stacks and Queues
- Look at the few basic operations on both respectively
- Know how they can be implemented

## Introduction
A Stack is a linear data structure like a list but a one in which insertions and deletions are only done at one end. It follows the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle.

A Queue is similar to a stack except for the fact that insertion and deletion operations are always done at opposite ends. It follows the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle.

For a Stack or Queue of fixed size and array can be used. However, if the number of elements is not known, dynamic memory functionlity is required and hence can be implemented using a modified linked list.
## What you must do
- Gain a Graphic Understanding of a [Stack](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1F2imiOJfk&list=PL2_aWCzGMAwI3W_JlcBbtYTwiQSsOTa6P&index=14)
- Read about the [Details of Stack](https://brilliant.org/wiki/stacks/). Pay attention to the complexities of different operations. You may ignore the implementation part for now.
- Get a similar understanding for a [Queue](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XuCbpw6Bj1U&list=PL2_aWCzGMAwI3W_JlcBbtYTwiQSsOTa6P&index=22)
- Read about the [Details of Queue](https://brilliant.org/wiki/queues-basic/#queues). You may ignore the implementation for now.

## Assessment Quiz

1. Which of the two follows the FIFO concept
   - Stacks
   - Queues*

2. Breadth First Search uses which data structre
   - Stacks*
   - Queues

3. Which one of the following is an application of Stack Data Structure?
    - Managing function calls
    - Arithmetic expression evaluation
    - Both of the above*

4. Consider the following pseudocode that uses a stack
```C
declare a stack of characters
while ( there are more characters in the word to read ){
   read a character
   push the character on the stack
}
while ( the stack is not empty ){
   pop a character off the stack
   write the character to the screen
}
```
What is output for input "ThisisMumbai"?
    - iabmuMsisisT*
    - ThisisMumbai
    - iabmumsisist
    - Thisismumbai
