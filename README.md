# The Minerva Project
Coding is the most sought after skill today. The Minerva Project aims at providing a platform to learn to code and hack it on your own. The Minerva Project consists of two carefully curated learning paths with set goals to learn Web Development. The two paths are [Front End Web Development (FEWD)](https://github.com/greyatom-school/the-minerva-project/tree/master/FEWD) and Back End Web Development (BEWD).

We believe that with the right motivation anyone can learn to code. There are ample amount of resources freely available online to learn anything, however many learners get lost due to this sheer volume of resources available. The Minerva Project aims to break this clutter and provide a guided path to the learners. All the resources used to build The Minerva Project are available for free.

Whether you are looking for your first job at a big tech company or just trying your hands on coding out of interest, The Minerva Project should help you reach the goal. 

## Our Philosophy
Our philosophy always has been learning by doing. One can master a skill only through hands-on learning. All the learning paths are designed with keeping this philosophy at the focus.

## How it works?
We have divided the learning paths into learning sprints which would further give a tighter control on learning to any learner. Each sprint has an end goal in the form of a project that needs to be completed by implementing all the skills learned during the sprint.  We recommend you to spend around 45 - 50 hours for every sprint.

At the beginning of each sprint, you will go through a high-level overview which describes what you will be learning and what you will be building during the sprint. Every sprint is further broken down into concepts and topics to simplify the learning experience. You need to navigate through all the topics, coding assignments, quizzes, and sprint end projects in order to successfully complete the sprint.

## Contribution
The Minerva Project is an open-source project. This means that if anyone comes across a resource that is better than what is currently included in our lessons, that person is free (and encouraged!) to add them, which improves our curriculum over time and helps it to stay up to date. Read our [contribution guidelines](https://github.com/greyatom-school/the-minerva-project/blob/master/contribution_guidelines.md) for detailed information.

## Code of Conduct
To keep the community warm, welcoming, and safe place we ask that all community members read and adhere to the [code of conduct](https://github.com/greyatom-school/the-minerva-project/blob/master/code_of_conduct.md)
