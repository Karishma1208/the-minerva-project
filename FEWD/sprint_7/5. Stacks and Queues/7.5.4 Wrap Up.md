# Wrap Up

## What you learnt
After a brief refresher of what stacks and queues are, looked into the basic FIFO,LIFO principles and listed out the basic operations. We also saw the costs of these operations. We implemented both stacks and queues using the array method and the linked list method. Remember how the linked list implementation was just a modification of insetion and deletion of a regular linked list.

## Key Takeaways
- Stacks follow the Last-In-First-Out policy
- Queues follow the First-In-First-Out policy
- While implemeting stacks using arrays, new elements are inserted regularly while deletions are are always made at the insertion end. The case for queues is opposite.
- While implementing using linked lists, insertions in stacks happen at the front and the head pointer must change everytime. In a queue, the insertion happend at the tail and you must remember to point the new node to NULL.
- Deletions in the linked lists are also simple. In both the stack and queue, the head is removed and the second node is declared as the new head.
- The insertion and deletion operations are called Push and Pop respectively for a stack
- They are called as Enqueue and Dequeue in queues.
- Some other operations include IsEmpty() and Top(). Top() returns the first element in the data srtucture.
