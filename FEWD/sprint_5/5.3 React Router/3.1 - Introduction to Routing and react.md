### Routing in React

We all know the various advantages of single-page applications over multi-page applications. Of all the various benefits, the fact that only one HTML page is involved makes SPAs much more preferable over their multi page counterparts. 
However, there are cases when you do need a multi-page feeling to your SPAs. Consider our ‘Build My Burger' project. Currently, we show the orders section using a modal. Wouldn’t it be cooler and much more aesthetic to have the orders section on a different page? Or for that instance, if we have a login section to our application, wouldn’t we like to have it on a different page?
We can achieve this multi-page feeling in SPA like React using a third-party library called ‘**react-router’**.

### Introduction to react-router

**‘react-router'** is a third-party library and the de-facto library for routing in React. It helps you to create routes to show various pages in React.
