# Walkthrough Solutions using D&Q Approach


## Overview
In this section, we will learn and explore the problems being solved using Divide and Conquer.

Having a solid grasp of Divide and Conquer approach/heuristic is essential as it is one of the most commonly used techniques and a lot of programming tests and interviews will expect you have this knowledge

## Learning Outcome
- What is Divide and Conquer?
- How can it be applied for solving different problems?

## Introduction

Divide and conquer algorithm works by recursively breaking down a problem into two or more sub-problems of the same or related type, until these become simple enough to be solved directly. The solutions to the sub-problems are then combined to give a solution to the original problem.

Let's take a naive example, we want to add 8 numbers

	93 42 13 54 19 29 8	64

We will this problem into 4 parts where we add 2 numbers at once

	93+42 13+54 19+29 8+64
	
	135 67 48 72

We have four numbers, but we will follow the same approach

	135+67 48+72
	202 120
	202+120
	322
