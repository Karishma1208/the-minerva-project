# Assignment: Competitive Programming Problems in D&Q
## Overview

We studied Divide and Conquer Approach, now we will use that for different problems.

## Learning Outcome

Implement the Divide and Conquer Approach for different problems

## What you must do?

Solve the following using Divide and Conquer Approach

- **Find the Missing Number in a sorted array**
Given a list of n-1 integers and these integers are in the range of 1 to n. There are no duplicates in list. One of the integers is missing in the list. Write an efficient code to find the missing integer.
		**Examples:**

		Input : arr[] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8]
		Output : 5

		Input : arr[] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9]
		Output : 7

- **Find the number of zeroes**
Given an array of 1s and 0s which has all 1s first followed by all 0s. Find the number of 0s. Count the number of zeroes in the given array.
		**Examples:**
		
		Input: arr[] = {1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0}
		Output: 2

		Input: arr[] = {1, 0, 0, 0, 0}
		Output: 4

		Input: arr[] = {0, 0, 0}
		Output: 3

		Input: arr[] = {1, 1, 1, 1}
		Output: 0
