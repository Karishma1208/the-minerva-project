# Basics of Linked Lists

## Overview
You have already been introduced to the basics of linked lists in sprint 3. It is one of the most crucial concepts in the data structures paradigm. We will revise a bit and brush up the requirements in this topic before diving deeper into implementations.

Questions on linked lists are very prominent in interviews. Being one of the most basic data structures, interviewers usually expect a thorough understanding of different operations on it. Best way to obtain this is to visualize every step in the process.

## Learning Outcomes
- Learn about arrays in low-level languages
- What is Memory allocation and how programs do it dynamically
- Why we need linked lists and a revisit to the concepts

## Introduction
Before we talk about linked list, we should understand why is it required at all. In fact, from the brief knowledge that you have, it is obvious that it is basically an array or a list of values. However, arrays in low level languages like C, C++ etc are static. That means, the size must be decided before hand and cannot be altered. This makes it difficult to store data whose size is not known beforehand. Thus enter Linked List, whose size is dynamically adapted to accomodate more data. Even though high level languages like Javascript, Python do not face these problems, it is imperative to study how it works under the hood.

In the case of an array, since the size is pre decided, the program alloctes the required memory in the RAM immediately and stores data as it comes. But in the case of a linked list, the memory is dynamically allocated as required.
## What you must do
- Understand how an [Array in a low-level language works](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-to-arrays/)
- Get a brief idea about [Dynamic Memory Allocation](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-dynamic-memory-allocation/). You may focus more on the exaplantion than the implementation.
