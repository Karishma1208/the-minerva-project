# Implementation structure of trees

## Overview
We studied what are trees, let's look dig deeper into one of the most commonly used trees - Binary tree and study its implementation.

Binary trees have some unique properties which make it quite valuable in computing. Based on these Binary trees, numerous other data structures have been developed all which have some really powerful features, having a solid grasp on binary trees is very important to progress into advanced computing.

## Learning Outcome
- What is a Binary tree?
- How to create a Binary tree?
- What are properties of a Binary trees and its different types?
## Introduction

Binary trees are trees with maximum two children nodes for each parent node, this makes the process of creation, insertion and deletion very simple as one now doesn't need to bother with the breadth at each node.

## What you must do?
Read about the [binary trees and the dynamic node representation of the Binary trees](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/binary-tree-set-1-introduction/)

Study the [array implementation of the binary trees](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0iHD18D072c)

Understand the [properties of the Binary trees ](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/binary-tree-set-2-properties/)

Check the [different types of Binary trees](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/binary-tree-set-3-types-of-binary-tree/)
