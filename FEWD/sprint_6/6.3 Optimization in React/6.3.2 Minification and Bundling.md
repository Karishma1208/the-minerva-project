### Minification and Bundling

Imagine this, you have create the perfect web application but the combined size of all your files including and not restricted to images, javascript files, styling sheets and node modules is a whooping 200 MB. Imagine the amount of time it would take the user's browser and more importantly, the network connection to download your files. 

Now, what if you had a method to reduce the size of your files without impacting the performance? This is what minification and bundling helps you achieve.
