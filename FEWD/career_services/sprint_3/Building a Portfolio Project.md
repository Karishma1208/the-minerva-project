# Building a portfolio that will get you hired

## Overview

As a web developer, having portfolio websites/projects gives you an edge over the competition. Your portfolio helps you show off your skills to a potential client/employer before even having met them. The ultimate purpose of a **portfolio project** is to provide a way for you to get more visibility, whether that means freelance work or employment at a company. While it is more in depth than a resume, it is visually more appealing and engaging too.

## What projects should you build?
Selecting projects to build and showcase on your portfolio can be very confusing. You will come across and come up with a lot of good project ideas. It's natural to want to build a lot of projects in order to have a "fuller" resum√©/portfolio but it's important to remember that when it comes to your portfolio it should always be **quality over quantity**.

Here are some tips and project ideas that will not only help you enhance your skills but also show a potential client/employer your skills:
- A productivity app (Eg. Pomodoro Timer, Reminder App)
- A clone (Eg. Netflix clone) BUT with a twist
  - It's very common to make website clones as a beginner that's why you should add some "twist" to your clone such as some additional features or design tweaks. This helps show that you have the capability to not only create pixel perfect website by refering to a design but also possess knowledge about UX(user experience) which is very important to have as a web developer.
- **DO NOT** USE FREE HTML TEMPLATES TO MAKE YOUR PORTFOLIO WEBSITE! Instead make a free HTML template for other to use.
  - This will help you enhance your skills greatly as you will need to consider a lot things such as responsive design, cross-browser support, theming etc. Things that you will tackle on a daily basis as a web developer.
- Remodeling generic projects
  - While following an online course you will have to make some projects and naturally you would like to show them off since you've put so much effort into making them. **BUT** remember that there are hunderds of other people who took the same course you did and built the same projects you did. What does this mean? This means that your project is very generic and will not impress an employer who will possibly have already seen a similar, if not the exact same, project before. That's why, as discussed earlier in the clone website point, you must add some "twist" to your project.

### **Pro tip** 
Build at least one project that solves a business problem. Now this may sound like a hard task but it's relatively simple if you're smart about it.

If you built a productivity app such as a generic todo-list then achieving this is as simple as remodeling it to be used as a "bug-tracking system" or take it one step further and change the logo of the bug-tracking app and advertise it as a "help desk ticketing system"

### **What must you do?**
- Beginners make some common mistakes while building these projects. Read and understand [what the common mistakes are](https://www.sitepoint.com/projects-can-sometimes-be-the-worst-way-to-learn-javascript/)
- Project ideas are hard to come by at first. Go through some of the already curated list of projects to jumpstart your portfolio building:

 *Note:*  While going through the project list, remember:
- The stack mentioned in the article is not mandatory. Pick one that you like
- Don't forget to add your own twist to the projects 

## How do you build them?
Once you've selected the projects you want to build now you have to think about how do you go about building them?

Here are some key things you should remember while building your projects:
- Keep it simple so you finish
  - So you decide to make big project and to add tons of features in hopes to impress your future client/employer. But guess what? It's too complex and you're not able to finish the project. Sounds familiar?
  - You should keep that project simple so that you can finish it ASAP. You can always revisit it and add more feautres later.
- Stick to `one` stack
  - Which stack you choose is entirely upto your preference. Recommendation is choosing one that aligns with the requirements of the company that you're aiming for.
- Write consistent, clean and reusable code
  
- Clean and professional UI
  - Any and every project you build **must** have an attractive UI, **must** have a responsive design and **must** have good browser support.
- Some features to consider adding in your projects: Filter, Search, Sort

## How do you show them off?
If you're at this stage that means you've put a lot of thought and effort into choosing what projects you want to build, you've successfully built them and now you're itching to show them off.

Here's how you create an impactful portfolio:
- Presentable UI
  - Again, the UI is the first thing the user sees and in this case the user may be your future client/employer, so it's important for them to be impressed enough to want to stay and explore your portfolio.

- Keep it simple
  - Your portfolio is not a place for you to put ypur entire life story. No. Keep it short and to the point.
- Don't exaggerate your skills
  - Just because you attented a course on Python, you're not a Python developer. The last thing you want is to be given work and you not being able to do it.
- Live examples/demos
  - This is where you showoff your projects that you put so much effort into building. Remember to provide links to a live demo and to your code repository.
- Be selective of your projects
  - Just because you built 10 projects during your journey of learning web development doesn't mean that you should put all of them on your portfolio. Choose about 4-5 projects that best represent your skills.
- Easy navigation
  - Remember your future client/employer could be looking at your portfolio and you do not want them to get lost looking for your projects or looking for a way to contact you. Your projects and contact information are of utmost importance so make sure they're easily accessible.
