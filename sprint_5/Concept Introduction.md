The previous concept introduced you to the world of ReactJS – a world replete with reusable components, simplified coding and unbelievable rendering performances. In this concept, we will deep-dive into the advanced concepts of React. At the end of this sprint, you will be well-versed with concepts like refs, fragments, HOCs, error boundaries and much more. You will also learn how to achieve the feeling of a multi-page application in React using routing.

## What will you be able to build?

At the end of this sprint, you will be creating a replica of Trello board application. If you are not aware about Trello, it’s a team collaborative platform created by Atlassian. It helps a software development team to keep track of the various tasks being handled during a sprint and the status of each task.
