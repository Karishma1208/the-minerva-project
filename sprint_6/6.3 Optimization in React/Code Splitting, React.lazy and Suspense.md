### Code Splitting

In the previous session, we learnt a great deal about bundling and how it solves our JavaScript problems. However, while bundling may statically reduce our web application size, if we are including the third-party libraries, there is every bit of a chance that your bundle size will grow. In that case, what will we do?

#### What you must do?

- Go through this article on [React's official documentation on Code Splitting](https://reactjs.org/docs/code-splitting.html). It also touches base on React.lazy and Suspense.
- This is [a detailed article](https://tylermcginnis.com/react-router-code-splitting/) on Code Splitting and React.lazy. It contains examples to learn the sessions.
