# Single Page Applications (SPAs)

## Overview

The new-age web applications don’t require reloading of pages.
Popular apps like Gmail and Facebook are examples of that.

In apps like that what happens is that JavaScript intercepts the browser events and instead of making a new request to the server, the client requests some JSON or performs an action on the serve. The page that the user sees never completely goes away, and behaves very similar to a desktop application.

These applications are known as Single Page Applications (SPAs). 

**ReactJS is a SPA framework**


In this topic, let's understand what exactly a SPA is.


## Learning Outcome

-	What are Single Page Applications?

-	How are SPAs different from traditional Multi-page Applications?

-	Why are SPAs better?

-	Examples of SPA


## Introduction


Traditional web pages like the one you made in earlier sprints consisted of multiple pages(Multipage application-MPA).

 By multiple pages, we mean to say that clicking on some HTML DOM element (not limited to anchor tag elements) would result in reloading the page and opening a new HTML file.
 
For examlpe, consider the [ADCI solutions website](https://www.adcisolutions.com/)

While the differentiation of the files was a good structure, reloading the page would involve a fresh download of resources and added waiting time depending on the network speed.

In stark contrast, Single Page Applications(SPAs) have only one HTML file and the content is updated on the DOM tree without having to reload the entire page. This saves a lot of network bandwidth and resources.
