# Introduction to Algorithms

## Overview

Now that we know the basics of how and why data must be organized in memory, this topic will cover how it can be used to solve problems. This is extremely important from a back end engineer point of view but in the modern market, companies want their engineers to have a well rounded foundation. Fluency to solve algorithmic problems is a must in an applicant.

## Learning Objectives

- What is an algorithm
- Why is it important in programming
- How to represent algorithms

## What are Algorithms

In simplest of words, Algorithms are the blueprints that define the step by step solution of a problem. For example, the algorithm to prepare an omelette is like

-   Get a frying pan
-   Get Oil
    -   Do we have oil ?
        -   If yes, put it in the pan
        -   If no, buy oil
-   Get an egg ... and so on<br>

Thus, and Algorithm  is the step-by-step unambiguous instructions to solve a given problem. It is usually evaluated based on its correctness and efficiency.

## What you must do

-   Understand [why algorithms are important](https://www.technotification.com/2019/02/importance-of-algorithms-programming.html)
-   Look at [basic programming algorithms](https://www.programiz.com/article/algorithm-programming)
-   Study the [flowchart representation of algorithms](https://www.programiz.com/article/algorithm-programming)
