# Basics Of Searching Algorithms

## Overview
Searching Algorithms are one of the most fundamental in Computer Science. They have wide applications in multiple domains. They form as building blocks of other more complex algorithms. It is important to understand how a computer searches for specific items in a group.

## Learning Outcomes
- Understand the importance of Searching algorithms
- Get the intuition behind different searching algorithms
- Solve Competetive coding questions on Searching

## Introduction

Searching is one of the core computer science algorithms. We know that todayâ€™s computers store a lot of information. To retrieve this information proficiently we need very efficient searching algorithms. There are certain ways of organizing the data that improves the searching process. That means, if we keep the data in proper order, it is easy to search the required element.
## What you must do

- Understand the implementation of [Linear Search](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/linear-search/)
- Understand the implementation of [Binary Search](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/binary-search/). Notice how binary sort is an example of the previously learnt Divide and Conquer paradigm.
- Read about the detailed [intuition behind binary search](https://medium.com/@jeffrey.allen.lewis/javascript-algorithms-explained-binary-search-25064b896470).
- Some problems you should attempt. Note the logic behind the solution and compare it with yours. The key is to develop algorithmic thinking
  - [Find the missing number](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/find-the-missing-number/)
