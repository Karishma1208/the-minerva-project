# Development and Testing

## Overview

Let's now move on to the SDLC step that as a web developer you will spend majority of the time working on

In this topic, we will understand the core part of a Software Development Life Cycle – Development and Testing.

As a web developer, this is a step that you can't show any ignorance or confusion about.


## Learning Outcome

It’s very crucial for you to have understood every phase of the Software Development Life Cycle up until this phase. If you have any doubts, kindly read through the previous topics again.

-	What is development?
-	What are the different types of development?
-	What are the best practices to be followed by a developer?
-	What is testing?
-	Why is testing important?
-	What are the different types of testing?

## Introduction

*Development*

Now that we have completed the requirements gathering, created prototypes and got it approved with the client, we finally move to core development – the phase where the product actually gets created. 
The stakeholders in this phase are the developers who are broadly divided into four criteria as shown below:

Depending on the type of product, there might not be a need for a database developer and a DevOps (Development Operations) engineer. However, almost every web development team always has a front-end developer and back-end developer.

Stakeholders involved: The developers are the only key stakeholders here.

Outcome of this phase: At the end of this phase, a working version of the software is created.


## What you must do?
- Read and understand all the key points about the [development phase of SDLC](https://www.thedigitalmentor.com/what-is-coding-in-sdlc/)

- Web development is diverse and therefore invariably consists of different roles. Learn(or revise if you already know) about the [different types of developers and the difference between them](https://conceptainc.com/blog/difference-front-end-back-end-development/)

Additional resources

- Upskilling in the required tech stack is incomplete if one isn't following the best(or most preferred) practices. Learn about [the best practices that need to be followed by every developer](https://www.marathonus.com/about/blog/14-best-practices-for-developers/)



*Testing*

For any product to succeed, it’s important that there are no bugs/defects, and this is the reason why testing is such an important phase of the SDLC.

Stakeholders involved: The testers/QA engineers are the primary stakeholders here.

Outcome of this phase: At the end of this phase, we will have the final product which will have been thoroughly tested. It can now move on the next phase which is deployment to be used by the user.


## What you must do?
-	Read and understand all the [key points about the testing phase in SDLC](https://www.thedigitalmentor.com/what-is-testing-in-sdlc/)

- Testing is often considered(and is) one of the most tedious process in the development cycle. Understand and imbibe the [need for testing](https://www.axistechnical.com/importance-testing-software-development/) 

-   There can be various bugs in development and therefore there exist various testing methods to catch and resolve them. Learn about the different types of testing, so you can be sure your web app is efficient and robust. 

-	A sandbox is a type of software testing environment that enables the execution of software or programs for independent evaluation, monitoring or testing(in a safe and economical environment).
