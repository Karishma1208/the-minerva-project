### Introduction

HTML is a `markup language`(not a programming language).

---

*Markup Language:*


A markup language is a computer language that consists of easily understood keywords, names, or tags that help format and give structure to text.

If removed or ignored, they leave the plain text as it is.

For eg.

Consider the text 'heading'

Without markup: 

heading

With markup(HTML tag): `<h2>heading</h2>` 

--- 

<h2>heading</h2>

---


As you can see adding the `h2` tag, it has resulted it the enlargement of the text. The adding of tags is referred to as 'marking up'

HTML being a markup language is used to tell the browser how to structure the web pages. It can be as complicated or as simple as the web developer wants it to be.  

HTML is what defines the content of `every web page` on the Internet. HTML "marks up" your raw content with HTML tags which helps web browsers understand how different parts of the content should be displayed.

**`Creating an HTML document of the content is the first step of developing a web page`**

Take a look at the following code snippet:


***
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        <!-- Metadata goes here -->
    </head>
    <body>
        <!-- Content goes here -->
    </body>
</html>    
```
***

This is the starting point for every single web page we will produce.

Web browsers are efficient but dumb. We need to tell the browser that this is an HTML5 web page with the <!DOCTYPE html> line. This is the string browsers search for when they try to display the web page

The above line is followed wth the `(<html>)` tag. Note this implies that the entire web page needs to be wrapped in` (<html>)` `(</html>)` tags.
