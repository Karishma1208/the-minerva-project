# Interview Prep


## Overview

Understand important FE concepts and prepare yourself for FE interviews

## Learning Outcomes
- Refresh your HTML/CSS knowledge
- Know and revise important JS concepts
- Know and revise important DS & A concepts
- Practice algorithmic thinking by programming
- Learn how to approach problems and develop critical thinking


## Introduction

So you have finished upskilling yourself in HTML/CSS and JavaScript.
You have good portfolio projects in your github. The next logical assumption would be is that you are ready for interviews. That unfortunately is not a correct assumption.


Front-end job interviews have great emphasis on algorithms/critical thinking and questions on expertise about the domain(HTML, CSS, JavaScript). That means they not only test you on what you know but also on whether you know where and how to implement your concepts in an efficient and scalable manner. This means that before going for FE interviews, let's brush up our knowledge.

FE Hiring typically involve two rounds:

- Coding Challenge Round

- Interview Round

Let's see how we can prepare for them by dealing with them one by one.

## *Coding Challenge Round*

This round involves solving coding challenges that test your programming language as well as algorithmic thinking.


## What you must do?

Every week, solve the seven coding challenges(minimum) given below.
After solving them, you need to submit the screenshots of the solution


Understand [how to submit the solution screenshot]()
