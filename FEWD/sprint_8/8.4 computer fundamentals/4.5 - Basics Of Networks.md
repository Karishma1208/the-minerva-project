# Basics of Networks

## Overview

After learning about operating systems and database management, the next topic that we will look at is networks. Studying networks gives us an insight how different systems disconnected by location or time keep in sync by communicating with each other.
As a frontend developer, who often is involved in sending and retrieving data from different servers, APIs, it becomes important to know how networks work.

## Learning Outcome
- What are networks?
- What are the uses of networks?
- What are different components of networks?

## Introduction

Technologies are evolving so fast. Networking world has changed so much in last 25 years. These days, networks with speed of 10 Gbps (Giga bits per second) are becoming common. The speed of 10 Gbps was not even imaginable 25 years back.

These days, even the smallest organization has a connection to the Internet. Almost all companies have websites and have their presence on the World Wide Web. Companies now operate on networks and do get customers via internet.

**Network**  is the interconnection of multiple devices, generally termed as Hosts connected using multiple paths for the purpose of sending/receiving data or media.

Computer networks are required for network communication and network resource sharing (printers, scanners, storage spaces etc). To build and connect computer networks, we need computers and special network infrastructure devices.
