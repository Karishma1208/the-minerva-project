# Deployment & Maintenance

## Overview

We are now at the final SDLC phases.

These phases are important because this is the implementation phase i.e. the phase that will be visible to the web app users/consumers.


This topic will help you understand the final two phases of Software Development Life Cycle – Deployment & Maintenance.


Learning Outcome

- What is deployment?
- How is deployment done?
- What is maintenance and why is it necessary?
- Who handles maintenance?


## Introduction

*Deployment*

The penultimate phase of the SDLC is deployment. After the product has been thoroughly tested, it’s time to move the product to the production environment where the users can officially use it. We will read more in detail about the process of deployment later in the sprint.

Stakeholders involved: Developers with DevOps speciality are crucial for this phase. Depending on the team structure, the rest of the developers also can pitch in with this task.

Outcome of this phase: At the end of this phase, we finally have a product which can be used by the client and the end users.


What you must do?
-	Deployment phase is when you deliver the product to the client and that of course makes the step very important. Learn and understand more about [the importance of deployment](https://www.thedigitalmentor.com/what-is-deployment-in-sdlc/)

*Maintenance*

Even after a product has been delivered, there are always chances of users encountering a bug. Moreover, at times the user might even request for an additional feature. 

This phase is called as the Maintenance phase of SDLC. This phase is what leads to longetivity of any web application you make.


Stakeholders involved: Every team member has a bit part role involved in this phase.

Outcome of this phase: Now that the product is developed and delivered, this phase is more or less never-ending until the product is decommissioned or destroyed. This phase just involves maintaining the product for consistent user experience.
