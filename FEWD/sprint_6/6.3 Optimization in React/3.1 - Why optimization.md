### Optimization

Following the best practices for development will definitely help you write clean and efficient code. However, if your website is not easily understood by the user or worse, it simply doesn't load, then rest assured, nobody will use your web application and you might even face the sack from your superiors. 

For that reason, along with good coding skills, you need to have an eye for optimization. Be it creating a web application like a 'Build My Burger' or a website for a corporate company, you need to know a good deal about optimization and SEO.
