# The First ReactJS Code

## Overview

After so much theory, it's now finally time to get our hands dirty with coding.

Before you begin this topic, it’s imperative for you to have a clear understanding of JavaScript basics and JSX. If you still feel overwhelmed by JavaScript, kindly go through Sprint 3 again before going ahead. 

Additionally, you need to have a clear understanding of what is JSX and how to create an element using JSX(Previous topic).

In this topic, we will learn and do some basic coding in ReactJS to create a similar page given below:

## Learning Outcome

-	Write basic code in ReactJS.



## Introduction

In this topic, we will be relying on [CodePen]((https://codepen.io/about)) to write our first React code. 



*Configuring CodePen for ReactJS*

Step 1: Open the [codepen](https://codepen.io)

Step 2: Click on the button ‘Start Coding’ on the left toolbar to open your working environment.

Step 3: Once you click on ‘Start Coding’, it will open up a window which looks something like this:

As you can see there are four windowpanes – one each for HTML, CSS, JS and a viewport to see the results. This is the basic setup for writing an HTML code.

Step 4: To enable React to work on CodePen, click on the ‘Settings’ icon on the top and move to the JavaScript tab. Check out this video sample below to understand how to configure the settings.

Congratulations! Now your CodePen is configured to code in React!

## What you must do?

-	Learn [how to create a simple element using ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/docs/rendering-elements.html) by going through the official React documentation.

## Coding Practice

Configure a CodePen to code in React and create a small 'About Me' page describing yourself.

The page should contain a header with your name and two paragraphs describing your age and your current education status/working profession.



*Step 1:*

Create a div element in "HTML window" with id= 'root'

*Step 2:*

Create a constant variable in "React window" called 'element'
and assign it the value : `(<div> </div>)`


*Step 3:*

Inside the `<div>` you just created, add all the required HTML tags for your profile content(for eg. `<h1>John Doe<h1>`)

*Step 4:*

Call the `render` function of `ReactDOM`. Inside that function pass `element` and `document.getElementById('root')` as parameters.

*Step 5:*

Style the content as per your wish in the "CSS window"
