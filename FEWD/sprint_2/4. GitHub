## Overview

GitHub is a platform that provides hosting for software development version control using Git. It is a subsidiary of Microsoft. It offers all of the distributed version control and source code management (SCM) functionality of Git as well as adding its own features. It provides access control and several collaboration features such as bug tracking, feature requests, task management, and wikis for every project.

GitHub offers plans for free, professional, and enterprise accounts. Free GitHub accounts are commonly used to host open source projects.

###Why GitHub?

As of 2018, GitHub reported having more than 28 million users, significantly more than its competitors. Most of the company prefers using this platform over any other for hosting code repositories.

The other differences involve cost. GitHub offers private repositories only at an additional cost, while a few of the other services offer private repositories for free. However, these typically come with limited storage and bandwidth.

Using GitHub makes it easier to collaborate with colleagues and peers and look back at previous versions of your work. If you aren't already using GitHub for your coding projects, here are a few reasons to consider doing so.
